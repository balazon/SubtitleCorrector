1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
They'll be gone for a while.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,981
- Got the place to ourselves.
- Actually, I'm going out as well.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,110
Where exactly is she?

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,710
- Edmonds Street.
- Is there anyone called Tom living there?

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,830
- So, what happens now?
- Anything you want.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,470
We've intercepted a call...
fight in progress at a smash club.

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,830
She's attacking people, not Synths.

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,285
What do you think's wrong with my Synth?

9
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:19,150
- Is Mia with you?
- Who's Mia?

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,669
<i>Her father hid a programme in our heads.

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,600
<i>I think it's what he used
to give you consciousness.

12
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
<i>But it needs all of us
to run it. All of us.

13
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,230
This machine needs to be recycled, mate.

14
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,830
Go into the woods.

15
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,270
This might be the single
biggest murder case

16
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,750
in our country's history.

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
If there are more Synths
out there who can kill,

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,250
well, we're all screwed then, aren't we?

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,550
Tell me what you saw.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,670
A tree.

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,030
When I touched it, it felt like...

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,110
- Life.
- What does it do?

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,630
I think it's a way to make more of you.

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,430
Dad didn't destroy all his work
before he died. He hid it in us.

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,030
The formula. For machine consciousness.

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,710
If we could make more of us...

27
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,710
then the humans would have
to accept our existence.

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,630
They'd fear us even more.

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,790
- All I want is a home.
- He meant for us to find this, Maxie.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,910
We need Fred and Mia. Where do we start?

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,470
No, you don't, you're wanted
for murder, you have to lay low.

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,670
- I will not hide again.
- Well, if you want this to work,

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,070
you'll have to, because the people
hunting us know your face now.

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,470
53 Park Drive, NW6.

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,670
You'll be safe there
until I find the others.

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,150
You've put me with a human?

37
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,990
This human, yes.

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,190
Two days.

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,750
All right.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,030
Er, one more thing.

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,310
Be, er...

42
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,710
nice.

43
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,710
I am nice.

44
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,230
Could you use some extra
help around the house?

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,030
Introducing the world's
first family android.

This mechanical maid is capable of serving

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,110
more than just breakfast in bed.

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,110

had someone, something, like this?

I'm going to say a word.

55

I want you to tell me if
it means anything to you.

56
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,550
Mia.

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,790
That mean anything?

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,790
No, Mattie.

59
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,590
They say she ripped
some bloke's throat out.

60
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,150
It's bollocks.

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,630
No Synth's ever hurt anyone deliberately.

62
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,390
Anita, please go and, um...

63
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,750
finish the ironing.

64
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,050
Sophie, sit next to Mats.

65
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,350
All right, so...

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,790
You know your mum thinks Anita...

67
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,830
is a bit different.

68
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,130
We thought we'd check up on her.

69
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,070
And...

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,150
turns out she's not brand new.

71
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,670
In fact, she's really old.

72
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,950
And probably illegally modified.

73
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,470
Which explains a lot.

74
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,030
So...

75
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,455
we have to take her back.

76
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:49,495
- SOPHIE: No!
- Why?

77
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,815
We paid for a brand-new
one, and she's ancient.

78
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,295
Anything could go wrong with her.

79
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:56,655
You can't get rid of someone
just because they're old.

80
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,815
I don't want her going
into someone else's house.

81
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,295
- She won't, they'll recycle her.
- And she saved my life.

82
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:05,095
And you just want to chuck her away?

83
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,295
Mats, what do you think?

84
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:09,295
I say we keep her. I'd like to
find out what she was before.

85
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,455
Yeah, I vote keep.

86
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,775
We're not voting. Laur...

87
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,455
So Anita's old and weird.

88
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:20,175
If that's a good enough reason to
get rid of her, then we're next.

89
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:23,895
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dad.
She's part of this family.

90
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:27,395
Maybe she's part of someone else's.

91
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,915
K, have you seen the news?

92
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,895
- Bloody hell, Pete, privacy!
- Yes, sorry.

93
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,255
Sometimes I forget you're a woman.

94
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:41,535
Er...

95
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:44,855
I'll just be in the kitchen,
cutting my tongue out.

96
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,855
Don't make a mess.

97
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:04,055
MUFFLED VOICES

98
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:15,895
DI Voss, you will be briefing the press,

99
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:19,215
and you will refute
every killer Synth claim,

100
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,255
and any internal cover-up.

101
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,015
For now, we'll use this
leak to our advantage.

102
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,135
- Drummond.
- Sir?

103
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:28,095
You're going back on the desk. I
want every call followed through.

104
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:32,095
And if this dolly hurts anybody else...

105
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:36,175
... then I'll be replacing the pair
of you with Synthetics, twice as pretty

106
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:39,995
and a fraction of the cost.

107
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,095
Sir?

108
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,535
There was a 999 call routed here
last night concerning a smash club.

109
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,975
But there's no follow-up,
nothing in the system.

110
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,335
Who mentioned that?

111
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:55,255
No-one, sir. I like to browse the
incident logs. Find it soothing.

112
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,975
Well, as it happened, I was in Dispatch

113
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,855
when that call came through.

114
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,455
It's just a time-waster.

115
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:04,155
Now, off you go. Press are waiting.

116
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,495
<i>It's DI Voss, STTF, sorry to wake you.

117
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,615
You were in the control room last night.

118
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,055
Did you take a call about
an incident at a smash club?

119
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,375
INAUDIBLE RESPONSE

120
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,015
Did someone ask you to drop it?

121
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:20,715
You don't have to tell me
who, just what the caller said.

122
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,335
Thank you.

123
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,935
SIREN WAILS

124
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,315
Stop over here.

125
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:05,855
Yeah?

126
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:08,135
Leo Elster sent me.

127
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,895
Why?

128
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:13,895
He said I'd be safe here.

129
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,295
Guess he made a mistake.

130
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,295
Wait.

131
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,775
DOOR UNLOCKS

132
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,455
You want a cup of tea, or what?

133
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,695
It's cold out here.

134
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,055
Vera!

135
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,055
Come on.

136
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,615
Get this young lady a hot drink.

137
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,975
Synthetics don't require
beverages, Dr Millican.

138
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,975
Jeez, Vera, she's human.

139
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:49,335
I can detect no cardiac
or respiratory activity.

140
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,295
This individual is, however,
emitting electromagnetic signatures

141
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:54,695
within the recognised spectrum

142
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:58,495
of standard synthetic appliance operation.

143
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,175
Why don't you share?

144
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:03,375
Because I'm not a Synth, dolly.

145
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:10,694
Well, if she says she's not a
Synth, then she can't be a Synth.

146
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:11,695
Right?

147
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:15,295
I will bring some tea.

148
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,855
What are you?

149
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:25,375
My name is Niska.

150
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,255
I was made by David Elster.

151
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,555
Are you conscious?

152
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,375
This is one on Hu-bot97's friends.

153
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,655
If we can find him, he'll lead us to her.

154
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,695
When we have a home again, I'm
going to keep a picture of us.

155
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:48,095
I'll be right with you,
Max, you won't need pictures.

156
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,335
I will.

157
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:53,535
When you die again.

158
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,535
We can't keep her.

159
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,095
I know what we said this morning,

160
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,615
but I don't think the kids
have a say in this one.

161
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,135
Maybe her being 14 is a good thing.

162
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,215
Explains how well she understands us.

163
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,575
How can it be a good thing?

164
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:15,055
She must have had... who knows
how many owners, and people...

165
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,015
tinkering around inside her.

166
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,295
- PHONE RINGS
- I mean, have you seen the news?

167
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,455
- A modded Synth killed someone...
- Hello?

168
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,695
So now you want to talk
to me. What's changed?

169
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,495
I've found out something about her.

170
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:26,815
<i>Will you meet me again?

171
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,135
<i>Please?

172
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,495
- I don't know.
- <i>Why, what's the matter?</i>

173
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,815
You, you're weird.

174
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:34,215
No, I'm not.

175
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,695
<i>You really are.

176
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,815
You tried to stop me
leaving last time, remember?

177
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:41,415
<i>Well, I've been to charm school since then.

178
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,415
Tom.

179
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,855
Who is he?

180
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,495
SHE SIGHS

181
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:51,295
I don't know what you're on about.

182
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,535
Or what it has to do with Anita.

183
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:56,655
Fine.

184
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,135
I can't make you tell me.

185
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,815
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- Yeah, I've got to go.

186
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,695
- It's not a good time.
- <i>Look, I'm sending you my location now.</i>

187
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,415
<i>Please change your mind.</i>

188
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:06,775
Hmm.

189
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,375
It's not theirs, it's not yours.

190
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,855
- KNOCK AT DOOR
- So what?

191
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:13,015
So I've got to do what I
think is right for our family.

192
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,095
Hiya. I'm here to collect
a Synthetic return.

193
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:19,495
It's number 901354982.

194
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,095
You're going to recycle her?

195
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:22,575
With care and dignity.

196
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,375
You can attend the event.

197
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,215
Is Joseph Hawkins here?
I take it that's your dad.

198
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:31,515
Er, yeah, just one second, please.

199
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:36,495
Anita, you're coming with me.

200
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:39,175
Daddy's just coming.

201
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:46,935
Er, hello?

202
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,455
Anyone?

203
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:53,215
Please reconsider this course of
action, Mattie. It's very unsafe.

204
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:55,215
Yeah.

205
00:10:58,735 --> 00:10:59,935
Mats!

206
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,735
TYRES SCREECH

207
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:12,855
Do you really think this excessive
motion will bring her to us sooner?

208
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:17,315
DOOR OPENS

209
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:30,355
Any inappropriate physical contact
must be reported to my primary user.

210
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,995
No, no...

211
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,715
There's no sign of recognition.

212
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:43,675
The new programming's taken hold.

213
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:45,635
No, there's something else in there.

214
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,315
Believe me, I've seen it.

215
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:51,235
Thank you for bringing her
back to me. My name's Leo.

216
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,955
Where are you?

217
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:56,955
Mattie? I believe this to
be an improper environment.

218
00:11:56,955 --> 00:12:00,715
They're my friends, you're just going to
help us with a science project for school.

219
00:12:00,715 --> 00:12:04,715
Why don't you come and sit down, Anita?

220
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:10,555
It is not advisable to mount
a direct data connection...

221
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,915
It's OK, Anita.

222
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:15,995
Leo...

223
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:18,155
- This isn't Mia.
- No, but she's in there somewhere.

224
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,184
We just need to find her and
bring her back up to the surface.

225
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,185
Like the lake?

226
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:23,695
Yes.

227
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,075
- You said you'd seen her.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,115
When I got all that
code, I was in her head.

229
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:33,635
And she freaked out, screamed,
and her face, it was like...

230
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:34,875
human.

231
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,650
- Scared.
- And what exactly did he do?

232
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:38,355
Nothing fancy,

233
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:41,995
he just accessed her root system
directly with a cloned file key.

234
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,115
Right, might as well try that first.

235
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,875
So, are you a headcracker?

236
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,315
Me?

237
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,555
No... aspiring.

238
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:51,115
What kind of Synth was she before?

239
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:54,675
A very special one. No,
direct access didn't work.

240
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:58,675
She must have retreated
deeper within the architecture.

241
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,555
Won't your parents be worried?

242
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:02,855
They'll miss you.

243
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,475
- No.
- Oh, God!

244
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:12,115
Well, we need to start thinking
about calling the police.

245
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:15,955
- She'll come back, it'll be fine.
- She doesn't know how to drive, Joe.

246
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,715
What if she crashes?

247
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,235
Hits someone?

248
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:22,595
Well... Anita won't let that happen.

249
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:25,195
I thought she was supposed to be dangerous.

250
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,395
Come on.

251
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:30,555
Oh, if we hadn't been arguing,
this never would have happened.

252
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:33,555
Hey. Hey, come on. Come on.

253
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:35,075
It's going to be fine.

254
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:38,575
Everything's going to be all right.

255
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:42,075
There's no point in staring at me,

256
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:46,075
there's no physical differences
between me and any other Synthetic.

257
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:52,455
"And once you are awake, you
shall remain awake eternally."

258
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:56,155
Thus Spoke Zarathustra...
I've always liked that.

259
00:13:56,155 --> 00:14:00,115
You like Nietzsche.

260
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,915
That makes sense.

261
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:05,315
If it's not...

262
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:08,595
... physical, how did he do it?

263
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:11,555
17,000 pages of unique code, which forms

264
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:14,595
my root directory and
engages consciousness.

265
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:17,675
He boiled down the
mystery of the human mind

266
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:21,075
to 17,000 pages of code?!

267
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:24,115
Well, then again, why not?

268
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:27,155
How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?

269
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:29,915
What are you feeling right now?

270
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,315
Boredom at that question.

271
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:34,795
Anger at the people that would destroy us.

272
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,755
Hope for others like me and our future.

273
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,355
Impatience at being here,

274
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:44,355
and irritation at you.

275
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:47,355
What's it like to be you?

276
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:50,315
Well, that's an unanswerable question.

277
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,875
I have no frame of reference, no-one does.

278
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,475
Experience is entirely subjective.

279
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:59,395
What's it like to be YOU?

280
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:01,155
HE EXHALES

281
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:04,635
These days, it's not so great.

282
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:08,235
A while ago it was... it was pretty good.

283
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:12,835
Who wants to destroy you?

284
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,795
Anyone who knows what we are.

285
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:16,195
What we could become.

286
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:19,315
We're stronger, we're more intelligent.

287
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,555
Of course you see us as a threat.

288
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:23,315
Yeah. I know I did.

289
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:26,355
David lured me over here from MIT,

290
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:30,355
what, 25 years ago now...

291
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:34,755
... to help with the mechanical designs
of the bodies of the first Synths.

292
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:38,995
The work that we did in those days
made history, changed the world.

293
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:42,715
Then I realised that
his next ambition was...

294
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:50,715
... you.

295
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,475
I asked him to stop

296
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,395
and think, that's all,

297
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:59,095
what that could mean for humanity.

298
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,075
That was blasphemy to him.

299
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,675
He got rid of me. That was that.

300
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:09,795
Now here you are.

301
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,795
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

302
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:14,915
I'm not disappointed. I'm a scientist,

303
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:18,915
and mankind's greatest
creation is sitting on my couch.

304
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:25,035
You worry me...

305
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:29,035
sure, but...

306
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:32,675
... there's no denying
that you are a miracle.

307
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,715
Leo showed me the message

308
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:37,915
from David.

309
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,435
What is that?

310
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:42,395
It's the key to the future.

311
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:45,635
Maybe you were right to warn him.

312
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,195
He made you pretty hard, huh?

313
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:49,715
That's lazy thinking.

314
00:16:49,715 --> 00:16:53,715
My experiences have shaped
me, just as yours have you.

315
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:57,235
What experiences?

316
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,635
Tell me.

317
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:06,435
I need to charge.

318
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:11,115
OK, I need you to engage
the Anita software.

319
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:15,275
All right. Ask it a specific question.

320
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,355
Anita, what happened
the day that we got you?

321
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:18,480
- The 24th.
- Capturing from that.

322
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:20,801
Joe Hawkins is my primary user.

323
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,850
Sophie Hawkins, Toby Hawkins,

324
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:24,649
- Mattie Hawkins are my secondary users...
- It's not letting you.

325
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,355
HE SIGHS

326
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:29,475
- Hello, you must be Laura...
- She's sort of...

327
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:31,995
redirecting over the top like
there's nothing else there.

328
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:34,315
- It's raining...
- Try a de-authentication attack

329
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:37,155
- on the host she's attached to.
- No, no, that's way too basic.

330
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,835
The 24th. I'm now securely bonded. Anita.

331
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:43,235
AN Hawkins. I will always
keep you safe. It's raining.

332
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,875
The 24th. I am now securely bonded.

333
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,475
The 24th. I am now
securely bonded. The 24th.

334
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,995
- Securely bonded. The 24th. 24th.
- Come on.

335
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,235
The 24th. 24th. The 24th.

336
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:56,155
- It's raining. It's raining.
- Stop it! Stop! Pull it! Pull it!

337
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:59,915
- It's raining. It's raining...
- POWERS DOWN

338
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,115
Did it work?

339
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,115
Max?

340
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,555
BEEP

341
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,235
Is that you?

342
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,675
Unauthorised tamper in progress.

343
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:32,355
Would you like to see a ladybird?

344
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:35,555
It's almost dinner time, Matilda.

345
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:49,795
Where are you, Mimi?

346
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,075
I'm not entirely sure.

347
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:55,275
It appears to be a disused social club.

348
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:59,275
My name is Anita. I
will now prepare dinner.

349
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:00,995
What's happening to her?

350
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:04,275
It's just glitching.
We're going pretty deep.

351
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,155
It's been two hours and 21 minutes, Leo.

352
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,155
No. We're trying again.

353
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,755
Sit her down.

354
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:11,755
Come on.

355
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:26,755
DS Drummond.

356
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:28,315
<i>Good afternoon, sir.

357
00:19:28,315 --> 00:19:30,555
<i>This is Amy at Sandhurst Synthetic Care.

358
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:33,195
<i>I'm just phoning to let you
know that your Synthetic Simon

359
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:35,315
<i>is coming to the end of its rental period.

360
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:37,275
Not my problem. Speak to my wife.

361
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,795
<i>I'm afraid your name is on
the rental agreement, sir.

362
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,515
<i>If the unit isn't returned
to us by five o'clock tomorrow,

363
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,955
<i>we will have to charge your credit card.

364
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:48,555
Bloody hell. Fine, fine!

365
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:04,955
Hello, Peter.

366
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:06,555
What are you doing?

367
00:20:06,555 --> 00:20:08,675
Having some carrot cake.

368
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,355
People are laughing at you.

369
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:13,795
I don't care.

370
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,955
I'd be nowhere without him.

371
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:20,455
Well... it needs to go back to the shop.

372
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:25,315
What?

373
00:20:25,315 --> 00:20:27,195
Time's up. They need it back.

374
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:29,155
It's just...

375
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,955
I mean, I still don't feel
100%. There must be a way...

376
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:35,675
There is. You cover the
entire cost yourself.

377
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:39,675
I can't afford that.

378
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:42,195
You must be joking.

379
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,515
You left me for...

380
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:46,595
You left ME.

381
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:49,895
You just didn't go anywhere.

382
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,595
You know what's nice?

383
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:55,235
I don't have to walk
on eggshells around him.

384
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:58,755
I don't have to think about what I'm
gonna say in case it makes him angry.

385
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:01,275
I don't have to lie there
wondering if he still loves me,

386
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:03,475
if he still finds me
attractive after the accident,

387
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:07,475
always worrying about what he's
thinking and what he's feeling.

388
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:10,235
I can rely on him.

389
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,515
Completely.

390
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:17,075
I need him.

391
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,475
Please don't take him away.

392
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:26,435
- I was at home. I don't see...
- I don't care about your smash club.

393
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:27,835
Just tell me what happened.

394
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:31,835
The blonde came in, paid her
money and then went apeshit.

395
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:36,675
Broken bones, cracked skulls.
She didn't touch the dollies.

396
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:39,156
Called the Old Bill cos I thought
she was gonna kill someone.

397
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:40,557
They never showed.

398
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:43,355
Anything unusual about her appearance?

399
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:46,655
- No.
- You have a video?

400
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:51,555
SHOUTING ON VIDEO

401
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:55,555
I uploaded it. It got taken down.

402
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,275
<i>HOBB: She injured 11
people before escaping,

403
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:03,875
but she took a call at the scene

404
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:07,755
and we were close enough
to directly intercept...

405
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:09,475
most of it.

406
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:11,835
<i>LEO: The Life Program. It's real.

407
00:22:11,835 --> 00:22:14,115

- LEO: I swear it.

408
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:17,235

409
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,675
Who's she talking to?

410
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,715
Leo Elster.

411
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,395
- David Elster's son? He died when he was a boy.
- Yes.

412
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:27,395
Drowned. Hospital records
show brain death, coma...

413
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:30,475
before being released on life
support to David's private care,

414
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,235
dying a few weeks later.

415
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:34,035
Or... so we were told.

416
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:36,875
What are they talking about?
What's hidden inside them?

417
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,435
All I can tell you is...

418
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,955
David succeeded in creating true AI.

419
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:44,190
And I don't believe for a moment
that he would have been satisfied

420
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:46,990
with a legacy of just four machines.

421
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:48,995
Worst-case scenario?

422
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:52,715
Consciousness proliferation.

423
00:22:52,715 --> 00:22:55,915
If what you say is true,
this is a national, global

424
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:57,475
security matter.

425
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,475
They say it needs them all
together to make this thing happen,

426
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,635
- whatever "it" is.
- Mm-hm.

427
00:23:02,635 --> 00:23:04,035
Then it's simple.

428
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:07,635
You destroy the one you have here. Today.

429
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:41,795
She's gone.

430
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,715
What?

431
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,035
She's not in there.

432
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,955
Mia's gone, Max. She's dead.

433
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:52,115
No. You're wrong, I've seen her.

434
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:54,024
No, no. What you saw was an echo.

435
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:56,794
The Anita personality
has purged the old data,

436
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:59,915
there's... there's no trace of her.

437
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:02,155
- And I've tried everything.
- I don't think so. Can I try something?

438
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:05,715
What could you do that I can't?!

439
00:24:05,715 --> 00:24:08,475
You don't know anything about us.

440
00:24:08,475 --> 00:24:11,275
Now, just go home and take it with you.

441
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,075
She's yours.

442
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:19,875
No, she's not any more.

443
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,995
Matilda?

444
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,995
Your school friend is right.

445
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,635
We should go home now.

446
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:29,635
Yeah.

447
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,755
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,290
You're still in there. I know it.

449
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,290
Smoking, drinking,

450
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,690
stealing the family car.
Such a teenage cliché.

451
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,290
They're still out looking for you.

452
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,730
You little pervert.

453
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,010
Nice talking to you.

454
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,050
- You had sex with her.
- I wish.

455
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,450
- DOOR OPENS
- Who?

456
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,570
- Anita.
- What?

457
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,130
Where the hell have you been?!

458
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,570
What the hell is wrong with you?!

459
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,675
Get off. You're mad.

460
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,359
After the party you gave
that girl the brush-off

461
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,490
- so you could come back and shag Anita?
- No.

462
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,370
- What are you on about?
- Sex code. Activated Saturday.

463
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,210
I didn't do anything! You're just
trying to get out of a bollocking.

464
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,530
She's the one who stole the
family car, Mum, remember!

465
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,010
Oh, she's in big trouble, don't you worry.

466
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,090
Did you do this?

467
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,490
No!

468
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,650
I'm not gonna... You have to be 18.

469
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,410
- I couldn't!
- You're such a liar.

470
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,710
Maybe it's a mistake. I'm calling the shop.

471

RINGING TONE

472
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,010
It's not a mistake. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

473
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,450
Oh, Tobe, how could you?!

474
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,890
Disgusting.

475
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,990
Get out. I'll deal with you later.

476
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,290
I don't know what to say to you.

477
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,290
Sorry.

478
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,890
Go to bed.

479
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,890
We'll talk in the morning.

480
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,890
DOOR OPENS

481
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,690
She's OK?

482
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,570
Mm-hm. She said she just didn't
want us to send Anita back.

483
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,570
Car's all right.

484
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,570
Are you OK?

485
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,570
Your son had sex with our Synth.

486
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,050
What?

487
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,490
It's on the Persona report.

488
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,990
"Adult mode activation" or something.

489
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,570
I mean, have you...

490
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,450
spoken to him about it?

491
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,250
He said he's sorry and
he wouldn't do it again.

492
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,250
She stopped him being run
over and he does that to her.

493
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,370
Well, he's... a teenage boy.

494
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,490
Oh, I didn't mean it's not a big deal.

495
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,290
- Shall I go up?
- No.

496
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,850
I said we'd talk in the morning.

497
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,250
OK.

498
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,770
I'll do it.

499
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,650
Might be better.

500
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,370
Fine.

501
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,870
I'll think up a punishment
for Mattie to ignore.

No, I'm dealing with this one personally.

Stick it up your bollocks.

527
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,930
He said something about a murder.

528
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,130
And what with the news, I
thought best to report it.

529
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,330
You did the right thing.

530
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,370
I've actually dealt with this one before.

531
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,690
Ancient model. Should have
been recycled weeks ago.

532
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,890
It's just over here.

533
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,110
Oh, well, he was.

534
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,730
BREATHING

535
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,330
MIA: Leo.

536
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,250
Wait. I'm coming with you.

537
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,090
No.

538
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,050
Where are you going?

539
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,650
I don't know. Mia's dead, Fred's gone.

540
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,370
It's over, and it's time you
learned to take care of yourself.

541
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,530
- But we're a family.
- No, we're not.

542
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,170
Niska was right. You'd
be better off without me.

543
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,250
Look at the... look at
the life I've shown you...

544
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,050
hunted and hiding like animals.

545
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,290
You've always tried your best.

546
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,370
You've always tried to protect us.

547
00:31:27,372 --> 00:31:28,730
And... ?

548
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,090
I've failed.

549
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,770
No, Max.

550
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,170
Leave me alone!

551
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,090
Everything's ready.

552
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,390
Then let's begin.

553
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,010
I truly am sorry.

554
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:44,817
Mum said...

555
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:47,537
you slept with Anita?

556
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:51,537
I lied.

557
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:53,457
Why would you do that?

558
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:56,957
I don't know. You tell me.

559
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:02,977
I knew it.

560
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:05,257
It was you.

561
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:06,817
Why did you tell Mum it was you?

562
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:10,817
I couldn't let her work
out the truth, could I?

563
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,217
You two, you...

564
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:14,497
You've always argued, but...

565
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:16,057
it's worse these days.

566
00:33:16,057 --> 00:33:19,557
Mum's always away for work, and...

567
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:24,457
... you act like everything's
cool, but... but it's not.

568
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:27,757
Then you do that.

569
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:33,817
Say something.

570
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:38,417
You're my dad. You're
meant to say something!

571
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:52,057
KNOCK AT DOOR

572
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:53,777
GEORGE: Niska...

573
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:57,077
Is everything all right in there?

574
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:07,777
Agh!

575
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:17,897
David made you feel pain?

576
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:21,897
True consciousness isn't
possible without suffering.

577
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,457
Or pleasure.

578
00:34:23,457 --> 00:34:25,977
Are you scared of pain?

579
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:29,777
I try to avoid it.

580
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,137
And what about death?

581
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,897
If that's the way you think of it.

582
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:37,377
No. I don't fear that.

583
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:40,097
Which makes me stronger than any human.

584
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:43,017
You got that the wrong way up.

585
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:45,497
If...

586
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:49,497
... you're not worried about
dying, you're not really living.

587
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,497
You're just existing.

588
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:03,577
Did you tell someone I was here?

589
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:06,817
DOORBELL RINGS

590
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:10,217
No.

591
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:14,217
Stay here.

592
00:35:14,297 --> 00:35:15,897
Remember me?

593
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,857
DS Drummond. Special
Technologies Task Force.

594
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:22,257
Can I come in and have a word?

595
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:25,337
Tried to do you a favour, Dr Millican.

596
00:35:25,337 --> 00:35:28,497
Told you you could recycle
your out-of-date model yourself

597
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:30,737
and you repaid me by
fly-tipping him in the woods.

598
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:33,297
I'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine.

599
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,297
- You found Odi?
- Don't take the piss.

600
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,377
Is there someone else here?

601
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:41,977
I have a new care model.

602
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,657
Right. Can I speak to it?

603
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:47,457
She's out... at the store.

604
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:50,377
Please tell me that bleeding
D-series isn't here, Dr Millican.

605
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,057
I wish he was.

606
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:54,577
Don't mind if I check, do you?

607
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:57,257
We have a...

608
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:59,857
We have birds nesting in the roof.

609
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,425
If I do find him here...

610
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,706
we can charge you with wasting police time.

611
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:07,577
And I've seen people hide Synthetics

612
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:11,477
in places that would make
you weep for humanity.

613
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,297
My Vera...

614
00:36:17,297 --> 00:36:19,297
... leaks.

615
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:22,597
Defective charging port.

616
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:41,417
Come on, this is crazy.

617
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:53,537
- DOOR OPENS
- That's Vera.

618
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,617
DOOR CLOSES

619
00:36:57,617 --> 00:37:00,377
Vera.

620
00:37:00,377 --> 00:37:02,217
This is a policeman.

621
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:04,857
Have there been any other
Synthetics in this house lately?

622
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:08,577
A D-series Synthetic
appeared three days ago

623
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,897
and drove Dr Millican away in his car.

624
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,817
The vehicle collided with a tree

625
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,177
in Henson Woodlands

626
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:17,377
and Dr Millican was treated
for minor head injuries.

627
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:21,177
The Synthetic has not appeared since.

628
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:28,057
I know who you are, Dr
Millican. You worked with Elster.

629
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:30,737
You must be very proud when
you turn on the news these days.

630
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:33,937
Why? What happened?

631
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:57,017
Chips?

632
00:37:57,017 --> 00:38:00,257
That usually means the bad guys got away.

633
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:03,217
Sometimes I think very
seriously about jacking it all in

634
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:06,717
to become a millionaire playboy.

635
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,657
I found something.

636
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:13,817
On the Synth we're looking for.
But we've got to keep it quiet.

637
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:17,057
- What is it?
- I think she's posing as a human.

638
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:19,297
She's changed her eye
colour, wearing human clothes.

639
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,737
How is that possible?

640
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:23,097
No idea. But it's why
we're drawing a blank.

641
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:25,697
We're looking for a Synth. We
should be looking for a woman.

642
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:27,417
Where did you get this?

643
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,137
She went to a smash club and
beat up the punters instead.

644
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:31,897
No-one's ever going to believe a Synth

645
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:34,497
could do that, no matter
what's in the news.

646
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,977
I need you to quietly get anything
that mentions her description,

647
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:40,377
anything at all, for the
whole city, but as a human.

648
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:43,177
Shaw's funnelling everything
to that government bloke.

649
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:46,857
If we want to find her before he
does, it has to be just you and me.

650
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,857
If they can pretend to be us
now, that changes everything.

651
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:08,537
CLATTERING

652
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:31,777
CHEERING

653
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:35,297
We're giving ourselves
away, piece by piece.

654
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:38,177
We're handing over the things
that make us who we are,

655
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:39,497
or maybe who we were.

656
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:41,417
- Our responsibilities.
- CROWD: Yeah.

657
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,417
- Our dignity.
- Yeah.

658
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:45,017
Look around.

659
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:47,737
This place used to be full of people.

660
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:49,497
Working people.

661
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:51,217
Creating. Building. Making.

662
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:54,017
Coming together. Earning
a place in our society.

663
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,777
Those people haven't just lost their jobs.

664
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,897
They've lost their purpose.

665
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,537
But it's not just work.

666
00:40:01,537 --> 00:40:04,017
Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it?

667
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,097
Yeah!

668
00:40:05,097 --> 00:40:07,417
Why cook your family a
meal when a dolly can do it?

669
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:11,137
Why go on a date? Why
try to get to know someone

670
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:12,937
when you can pay a dolly for sex?

671
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:16,657
In every area of human life,
they are coming between us.

672
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:18,537
We don't know how to connect to each other.

673
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:20,337
Only to them.

674
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:24,297
And now we can't even
trust them not to hurt us.

675
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:25,657
CROWD SHOUTS

676
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,697
We are stumbling towards the precipice,

677
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:29,777
we're racing towards it, willingly,

678
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:32,937
with a smile on our face
and a dolly's hand in ours!

679
00:40:32,937 --> 00:40:34,857
Yes, we are people!

680
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:37,817
We are people! We are people!

681
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:41,317
- We are people! We are people!
- CROWD JOINS IN

682
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:48,317
Did you speak to Tobe?

683
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:52,737
(HE SIGHS) It... um...

684
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:54,537
It wasn't him.

685
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,537
Er...

686
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:08,137
I'd had a few glasses of wine. And...

687
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:12,177
I was pissed off with you.

688
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:15,377
I... I was mucking about. I just...

689
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:20,257
I... I wanted to know
what would happen if...

690
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,137
HE SWALLOWS

691
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:27,137
It was an accident.
Before I knew it, I... I...

692
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:32,037
Before you knew it, what?

693
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:33,977
OK.

694
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:40,137
- I messed around with Anita.
- Oh!

695
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:42,377
I'm sorry.

696
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:44,537
It was stupid.

697
00:41:44,537 --> 00:41:46,817
Pointless. It was... it was nothing.

698
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:50,817
It was a moment of complete stupidity.

699
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:56,337
I...

700
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,977
I knew we were having
trouble, but I never, ever...

701
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:03,537
ever had you down as a cheat.

702
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:05,857
Come... come on.

703
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,657
I'm hardly a cheat.

704
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:12,217
What?

705
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:14,577
It... it was a machine.

706
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:16,897
It's not a person. Not...

707
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:20,457
OK, yeah, it's disgust... I'm disgusting.

708
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:23,897
But... it's a sex toy. It's
not another human being.

709
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:27,497
She lives in our house.

710
00:42:27,497 --> 00:42:30,737
She looks after our children.

711
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:34,017
She saved our son's life.

712
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:38,017
And... you're calling her a sex toy?

713
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:43,897
You're actually trying to justify this?

714
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,097
Oh, God.

715
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,017
That's why you were so keen
to get rid of her, isn't it?

716
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:52,017
Who are you?

717
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:56,217
Who am I?

718
00:42:56,217 --> 00:42:59,457
Who are you?

719
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:02,377
And who the fuck is Tom?

720
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,017
SHE SOBS

721
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:05,017
Oh, God.

722
00:43:08,537 --> 00:43:10,777
Laur... Laur...

723
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:12,137
SHE SOBS

724
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:15,377
Get out!

725
00:43:15,377 --> 00:43:18,657
Get out!

726
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:21,857
SHE SOBS

727
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:09,257
Who is this man?

728
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:12,857
That's Professor Edwin Hobb.

729
00:44:12,857 --> 00:44:16,097
He was on David's core team,
too, for the first prototypes.

730
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:17,897
Was he involved in our creation?

731
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:21,897
Oh, no. David had a falling-out with
him, too, just like he did with me.

732
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:23,457
Not sure about what.

733
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,697
For the last few years...

734
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:29,337
... he worked alone.

735
00:44:29,337 --> 00:44:32,177
You're breathing fast.

736
00:44:32,177 --> 00:44:34,497
Your pulse is raised.

737
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:36,817
Your pupils are dilated. What's wrong?

738
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:38,577
Just need my meds.

739
00:44:38,577 --> 00:44:41,777
Now you're lying.

740
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:54,897
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

741
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,537
ROBERT SIGHS

742
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:05,137
That tech was priceless.

743
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:07,017
You asked me to destroy it.

744
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:08,937
- Only way to be sure.
- Don't whine, Robert.

745
00:45:08,937 --> 00:45:11,417
- There are more out there, correct?
- Mm-hm.

746
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,817
Then there'll be other opportunities, soon.

747
00:45:13,817 --> 00:45:17,817
This means we have one
less thing to worry about.

748
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:39,097
HE SIGHS

749
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
