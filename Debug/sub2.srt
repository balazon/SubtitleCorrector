1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
They'll be gone for a while.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,981
- Got the place to ourselves.
- Actually, I'm going out as well.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,110
Where exactly is she?

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,710
- Edmonds Street.
- Is there anyone called Tom living there?

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,830
- So, what happens now?
- Anything you want.

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,470
We've intercepted a call...
fight in progress at a smash club.

7
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,830
She's attacking people, not Synths.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,285
What do you think's wrong with my Synth?

9
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,150
- Is Mia with you?
- Who's Mia?

10
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:25,669
<i>Her father hid a programme in our heads.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,600
<i>I think it's what he used
to give you consciousness.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>But it needs all of us
to run it. All of us.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,230
This machine needs to be recycled, mate.

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,830
Go into the woods.

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,270
This might be the single
biggest murder case

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,750
in our country's history.

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,750
If there are more Synths
out there who can kill,

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,250
well, we're all screwed then, aren't we?

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,550
Tell me what you saw.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,670
A tree.

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,030
When I touched it, it felt like...

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,110
- Life.
- What does it do?

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,630
I think it's a way to make more of you.

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,430
Dad didn't destroy all his work
before he died. He hid it in us.

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,030
The formula. For machine consciousness.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,710
If we could make more of us...

27
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,710
then the humans would have
to accept our existence.

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,630
They'd fear us even more.

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,790
- All I want is a home.
- He meant for us to find this, Maxie.

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,910
We need Fred and Mia. Where do we start?

31
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,470
No, you don't, you're wanted
for murder, you have to lay low.

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,670
- I will not hide again.
- Well, if you want this to work,

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,070
you'll have to, because the people
hunting us know your face now.

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,470
53 Park Drive, NW6.

35
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,670
You'll be safe there
until I find the others.

36
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,150
You've put me with a human?

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,990
This human, yes.

38
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,190
Two days.

39
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,750
All right.

40
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,030
Er, one more thing.

41
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,310
Be, er...

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,710
nice.

43
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,710
I am nice.

44
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,230
Could you use some extra
help around the house?

45
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,030
Introducing the world's
first family android.

This mechanical maid is capable of serving

48
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,110
more than just breakfast in bed.

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,110

had someone, something, like this?

I'm going to say a word.

55

I want you to tell me if
it means anything to you.

56
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,550
Mia.

57
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,790
That mean anything?

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,790
No, Mattie.

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,590
They say she ripped
some bloke's throat out.

60
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,150
It's bollocks.

61
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,630
No Synth's ever hurt anyone deliberately.

62
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,390
Anita, please go and, um...

63
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,750
finish the ironing.

64
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,050
Sophie, sit next to Mats.

65
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,350
All right, so...

66
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,790
You know your mum thinks Anita...

67
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,830
is a bit different.

68
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,130
We thought we'd check up on her.

69
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,070
And...

70
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,150
turns out she's not brand new.

71
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,670
In fact, she's really old.

72
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,950
And probably illegally modified.

73
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,470
Which explains a lot.

74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,030
So...

75
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,455
we have to take her back.

76
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,495
- SOPHIE: No!
- Why?

77
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,815
We paid for a brand-new
one, and she's ancient.

78
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,295
Anything could go wrong with her.

79
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,655
You can't get rid of someone
just because they're old.

80
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,815
I don't want her going
into someone else's house.

81
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:06,295
- She won't, they'll recycle her.
- And she saved my life.

82
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:10,095
And you just want to chuck her away?

83
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:11,295
Mats, what do you think?

84
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:14,295
I say we keep her. I'd like to
find out what she was before.

85
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,455
Yeah, I vote keep.

86
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:18,775
We're not voting. Laur...

87
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:21,455
So Anita's old and weird.

88
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:25,175
If that's a good enough reason to
get rid of her, then we're next.

89
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:28,895
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dad.
She's part of this family.

90
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:32,395
Maybe she's part of someone else's.

91
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:37,915
K, have you seen the news?

92
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:41,895
- Bloody hell, Pete, privacy!
- Yes, sorry.

93
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:44,255
Sometimes I forget you're a woman.

94
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:46,535
Er...

95
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,855
I'll just be in the kitchen,
cutting my tongue out.

96
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,855
Don't make a mess.

97
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,055
MUFFLED VOICES

98
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:20,895
DI Voss, you will be briefing the press,

99
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:24,215
and you will refute
every killer Synth claim,

100
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:26,255
and any internal cover-up.

101
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:29,015
For now, we'll use this
leak to our advantage.

102
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,135
- Drummond.
- Sir?

103
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:33,095
You're going back on the desk. I
want every call followed through.

104
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:37,095
And if this dolly hurts anybody else...

105
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:41,175
... then I'll be replacing the pair
of you with Synthetics, twice as pretty

106
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:44,995
and a fraction of the cost.

107
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,095
Sir?

108
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:53,535
There was a 999 call routed here
last night concerning a smash club.

109
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,975
But there's no follow-up,
nothing in the system.

110
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,335
Who mentioned that?

111
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,255
No-one, sir. I like to browse the
incident logs. Find it soothing.

112
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:01,975
Well, as it happened, I was in Dispatch

113
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,855
when that call came through.

114
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:05,455
It's just a time-waster.

115
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:09,155
Now, off you go. Press are waiting.

116
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:13,495
<i>It's DI Voss, STTF, sorry to wake you.

117
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,615
You were in the control room last night.

118
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:18,055
Did you take a call about
an incident at a smash club?

119
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:19,375
INAUDIBLE RESPONSE

120
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,015
Did someone ask you to drop it?

121
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,715
You don't have to tell me
who, just what the caller said.

122
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:35,335
Thank you.

123
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:51,935
SIREN WAILS

124
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:02,315
Stop over here.

125
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,855
Yeah?

126
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:13,135
Leo Elster sent me.

127
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:14,895
Why?

128
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:18,895
He said I'd be safe here.

129
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:22,295
Guess he made a mistake.

130
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:23,295
Wait.

131
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,775
DOOR UNLOCKS

132
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,455
You want a cup of tea, or what?

133
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:33,695
It's cold out here.

134
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,055
Vera!

135
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,055
Come on.

136
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,615
Get this young lady a hot drink.

137
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:45,975
Synthetics don't require
beverages, Dr Millican.

138
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,975
Jeez, Vera, she's human.

139
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:54,335
I can detect no cardiac
or respiratory activity.

140
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:58,295
This individual is, however,
emitting electromagnetic signatures

141
00:07:58,295 --> 00:07:59,695
within the recognised spectrum

142
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:03,495
of standard synthetic appliance operation.

143
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,175
Why don't you share?

144
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:08,375
Because I'm not a Synth, dolly.

145
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:15,694
Well, if she says she's not a
Synth, then she can't be a Synth.

146
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,695
Right?

147
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,295
I will bring some tea.

148
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:28,855
What are you?

149
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,375
My name is Niska.

150
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,255
I was made by David Elster.

151
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:36,555
Are you conscious?

152
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,375
This is one on Hu-bot97's friends.

153
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,655
If we can find him, he'll lead us to her.

154
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:50,695
When we have a home again, I'm
going to keep a picture of us.

155
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,095
I'll be right with you,
Max, you won't need pictures.

156
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:55,335
I will.

157
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,535
When you die again.

158
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,535
We can't keep her.

159
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:08,095
I know what we said this morning,

160
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,615
but I don't think the kids
have a say in this one.

161
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:12,135
Maybe her being 14 is a good thing.

162
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,215
Explains how well she understands us.

163
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:16,575
How can it be a good thing?

164
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,055
She must have had... who knows
how many owners, and people...

165
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,015
tinkering around inside her.

166
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:24,295
- PHONE RINGS
- I mean, have you seen the news?

167
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,455
- A modded Synth killed someone...
- Hello?

168
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,695
So now you want to talk
to me. What's changed?

169
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,495
I've found out something about her.

170
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:31,815
<i>Will you meet me again?

171
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:33,135
<i>Please?

172
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,495
- I don't know.
- <i>Why, what's the matter?</i>

173
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,815
You, you're weird.

174
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:39,215
No, I'm not.

175
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,695
<i>You really are.

176
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,815
You tried to stop me
leaving last time, remember?

177
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,415
<i>Well, I've been to charm school since then.

178
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:50,415
Tom.

179
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,855
Who is he?

180
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:54,495
SHE SIGHS

181
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,295
I don't know what you're on about.

182
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,535
Or what it has to do with Anita.

183
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:01,655
Fine.

184
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,135
I can't make you tell me.

185
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,815
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- Yeah, I've got to go.

186
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,695
- It's not a good time.
- <i>Look, I'm sending you my location now.</i>

187
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,415
<i>Please change your mind.</i>

188
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:11,775
Hmm.

189
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,375
It's not theirs, it's not yours.

190
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,855
- KNOCK AT DOOR
- So what?

191
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:18,015
So I've got to do what I
think is right for our family.

192
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:21,095
Hiya. I'm here to collect
a Synthetic return.

193
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:24,495
It's number 901354982.

194
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,095
You're going to recycle her?

195
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,575
With care and dignity.

196
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:30,375
You can attend the event.

197
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,215
Is Joseph Hawkins here?
I take it that's your dad.

198
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,515
Er, yeah, just one second, please.

199
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,495
Anita, you're coming with me.

200
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,175
Daddy's just coming.

201
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:51,935
Er, hello?

202
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,455
Anyone?

203
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:58,215
Please reconsider this course of
action, Mattie. It's very unsafe.

204
00:10:58,215 --> 00:11:00,215
Yeah.

205
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:04,935
Mats!

206
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:08,735
TYRES SCREECH

207
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:17,855
Do you really think this excessive
motion will bring her to us sooner?

208
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:26,945
DOOR OPENS

209
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:41,355
Any inappropriate physical contact
must be reported to my primary user.

210
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,995
No, no...

211
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,715
There's no sign of recognition.

212
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,675
The new programming's taken hold.

213
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,635
No, there's something else in there.

214
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:58,315
Believe me, I've seen it.

215
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:02,235
Thank you for bringing her
back to me. My name's Leo.

216
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,955
Where are you?

217
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:07,955
Mattie? I believe this to
be an improper environment.

218
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:11,715
They're my friends, you're just going to
help us with a science project for school.

219
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:15,715
Why don't you come and sit down, Anita?

220
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:21,554
It is not advisable to mount
a direct data connection...

221
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:23,914
It's OK, Anita.

222
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:26,995
Leo...

223
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,155
- This isn't Mia.
- No, but she's in there somewhere.

224
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:31,184
We just need to find her and
bring her back up to the surface.

225
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,185
Like the lake?

226
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:34,695
Yes.

227
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,075
- You said you'd seen her.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,115
When I got all that
code, I was in her head.

229
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:44,635
And she freaked out, screamed,
and her face, it was like...

230
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:45,875
human.

231
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,650
- Scared.
- And what exactly did he do?

232
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:49,355
Nothing fancy,

233
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:52,995
he just accessed her root system
directly with a cloned file key.

234
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:55,115
Right, might as well try that first.

235
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,874
So, are you a headcracker?

236
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,315
Me?

237
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:00,555
No... aspiring.

238
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,115
What kind of Synth was she before?

239
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,675
A very special one. No,
direct access didn't work.

240
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:09,675
She must have retreated
deeper within the architecture.

241
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,555
Won't your parents be worried?

242
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:13,855
They'll miss you.

243
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,474
- No.
- Oh, God!

244
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,115
Well, we need to start thinking
about calling the police.

245
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:26,955
- She'll come back, it'll be fine.
- She doesn't know how to drive, Joe.

246
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:28,715
What if she crashes?

247
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:30,234
Hits someone?

248
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:33,595
Well... Anita won't let that happen.

249
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:36,195
I thought she was supposed to be dangerous.

250
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,395
Come on.

251
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:41,555
Oh, if we hadn't been arguing,
this never would have happened.

252
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,555
Hey. Hey, come on. Come on.

253
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:46,075
It's going to be fine.

254
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,575
Everything's going to be all right.

255
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,075
There's no point in staring at me,

256
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:57,074
there's no physical differences
between me and any other Synthetic.

257
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:03,455
"And once you are awake, you
shall remain awake eternally."

258
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:07,155
Thus Spoke Zarathustra...
I've always liked that.

259
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:11,115
You like Nietzsche.

260
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,915
That makes sense.

261
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:16,315
If it's not...

262
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,595
... physical, how did he do it?

263
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,555
17,000 pages of unique code, which forms

264
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,595
my root directory and
engages consciousness.

265
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:28,674
He boiled down the
mystery of the human mind

266
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:32,075
to 17,000 pages of code?!

267
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:35,115
Well, then again, why not?

268
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:38,155
How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?

269
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:40,915
What are you feeling right now?

270
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:42,315
Boredom at that question.

271
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,795
Anger at the people that would destroy us.

272
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:48,755
Hope for others like me and our future.

273
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,355
Impatience at being here,

274
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:55,355
and irritation at you.

275
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:58,355
What's it like to be you?

276
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:01,315
Well, that's an unanswerable question.

277
00:15:01,315 --> 00:15:04,875
I have no frame of reference, no-one does.

278
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,475
Experience is entirely subjective.

279
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:10,395
What's it like to be YOU?

280
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,155
HE EXHALES

281
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:15,635
These days, it's not so great.

282
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:19,235
A while ago it was... it was pretty good.

283
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,835
Who wants to destroy you?

284
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,795
Anyone who knows what we are.

285
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:27,195
What we could become.

286
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,315
We're stronger, we're more intelligent.

287
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,555
Of course you see us as a threat.

288
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,315
Yeah. I know I did.

289
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:37,355
David lured me over here from MIT,

290
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:41,355
what, 25 years ago now...

291
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:45,755
... to help with the mechanical designs
of the bodies of the first Synths.

292
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:49,995
The work that we did in those days
made history, changed the world.

293
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,715
Then I realised that
his next ambition was...

294
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:01,715
... you.

295
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,475
I asked him to stop

296
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,395
and think, that's all,

297
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:10,095
what that could mean for humanity.

298
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:14,075
That was blasphemy to him.

299
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:17,675
He got rid of me. That was that.

300
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:20,795
Now here you are.

301
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,795
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

302
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:25,915
I'm not disappointed. I'm a scientist,

303
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,915
and mankind's greatest
creation is sitting on my couch.

304
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:36,035
You worry me...

305
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:40,035
sure, but...

306
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:43,675
... there's no denying
that you are a miracle.

307
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,715
Leo showed me the message

308
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,915
from David.

309
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:50,435
What is that?

310
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:53,395
It's the key to the future.

311
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:56,635
Maybe you were right to warn him.

312
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,195
He made you pretty hard, huh?

313
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,715
That's lazy thinking.

314
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:04,715
My experiences have shaped
me, just as yours have you.

315
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,235
What experiences?

316
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:13,635
Tell me.

317
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:17,435
I need to charge.

318
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:22,115
OK, I need you to engage
the Anita software.

319
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:26,275
All right. Ask it a specific question.

320
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,355
Anita, what happened
the day that we got you?

321
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:29,480
- The 24th.
- Capturing from that.

322
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,801
Joe Hawkins is my primary user.

323
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,850
Sophie Hawkins, Toby Hawkins,

324
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:35,649
- Mattie Hawkins are my secondary users...
- It's not letting you.

325
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:37,355
HE SIGHS

326
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:40,475
- Hello, you must be Laura...
- She's sort of...

327
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,995
redirecting over the top like
there's nothing else there.

328
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,315
- It's raining...
- Try a de-authentication attack

329
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,155
- on the host she's attached to.
- No, no, that's way too basic.

330
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:50,835
The 24th. I'm now securely bonded. Anita.

331
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:54,235
AN Hawkins. I will always
keep you safe. It's raining.

332
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,875
The 24th. I am now securely bonded.

333
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,475
The 24th. I am now
securely bonded. The 24th.

334
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,995
- Securely bonded. The 24th. 24th.
- Come on.

335
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:04,235
The 24th. 24th. The 24th.

336
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:07,155
- It's raining. It's raining.
- Stop it! Stop! Pull it! Pull it!

337
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:10,915
- It's raining. It's raining...
- POWERS DOWN

338
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:13,115
Did it work?

339
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,115
Max?

340
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,555
BEEP

341
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,235
Is that you?

342
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,675
Unauthorised tamper in progress.

343
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:43,355
Would you like to see a ladybird?

344
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,555
It's almost dinner time, Matilda.

345
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:00,795
Where are you, Mimi?

346
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:03,075
I'm not entirely sure.

347
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,275
It appears to be a disused social club.

348
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:10,275
My name is Anita. I
will now prepare dinner.

349
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,995
What's happening to her?

350
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:15,275
It's just glitching.
We're going pretty deep.

351
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:17,155
It's been two hours and 21 minutes, Leo.

352
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,155
No. We're trying again.

353
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,755
Sit her down.

354
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:22,755
Come on.

355
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,755
DS Drummond.

356
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:39,315
<i>Good afternoon, sir.

357
00:19:39,315 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>This is Amy at Sandhurst Synthetic Care.

358
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,195
<i>I'm just phoning to let you
know that your Synthetic Simon

359
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,315
<i>is coming to the end of its rental period.

360
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,275
Not my problem. Speak to my wife.

361
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:50,795
<i>I'm afraid your name is on
the rental agreement, sir.

362
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:53,515
<i>If the unit isn't returned
to us by five o'clock tomorrow,

363
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:54,955
<i>we will have to charge your credit card.

364
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:59,555
Bloody hell. Fine, fine!

365
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:15,955
Hello, Peter.

366
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,555
What are you doing?

367
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:19,675
Having some carrot cake.

368
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:22,355
People are laughing at you.

369
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,795
I don't care.

370
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,955
I'd be nowhere without him.

371
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:31,455
Well... it needs to go back to the shop.

372
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:36,315
What?

373
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,195
Time's up. They need it back.

374
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,155
It's just...

375
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,955
I mean, I still don't feel
100%. There must be a way...

376
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,675
There is. You cover the
entire cost yourself.

377
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:50,675
I can't afford that.

378
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:53,195
You must be joking.

379
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,515
You left me for...

380
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:57,595
You left ME.

381
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:00,895
You just didn't go anywhere.

382
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,595
You know what's nice?

383
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,235
I don't have to walk
on eggshells around him.

384
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,755
I don't have to think about what I'm
gonna say in case it makes him angry.

385
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:12,275
I don't have to lie there
wondering if he still loves me,

386
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,475
if he still finds me
attractive after the accident,

387
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:18,475
always worrying about what he's
thinking and what he's feeling.

388
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,235
I can rely on him.

389
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:24,515
Completely.

390
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:28,075
I need him.

391
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:31,475
Please don't take him away.

392
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:37,435
- I was at home. I don't see...
- I don't care about your smash club.

393
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:38,835
Just tell me what happened.

394
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:42,835
The blonde came in, paid her
money and then went apeshit.

395
00:21:43,675 --> 00:21:47,675
Broken bones, cracked skulls.
She didn't touch the dollies.

396
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,156
Called the Old Bill cos I thought
she was gonna kill someone.

397
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:51,557
They never showed.

398
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:54,355
Anything unusual about her appearance?

399
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,655
- No.
- You have a video?

400
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,555
SHOUTING ON VIDEO

401
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:06,555
I uploaded it. It got taken down.

402
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:13,275
<i>HOBB: She injured 11
people before escaping,

403
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,875
but she took a call at the scene

404
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,755
and we were close enough
to directly intercept...

405
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,475
most of it.

406
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:22,835
<i>LEO: The Life Program. It's real.

407
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,115

- LEO: I swear it.

408
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:28,235

409
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:29,675
Who's she talking to?

410
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,715
Leo Elster.

411
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:34,395
- David Elster's son? He died when he was a boy.
- Yes.

412
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:38,395
Drowned. Hospital records
show brain death, coma...

413
00:22:38,675 --> 00:22:41,475
before being released on life
support to David's private care,

414
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:43,235
dying a few weeks later.

415
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:45,035
Or... so we were told.

416
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:47,875
What are they talking about?
What's hidden inside them?

417
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,435
All I can tell you is...

418
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,955
David succeeded in creating true AI.

419
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,190
And I don't believe for a moment
that he would have been satisfied

420
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,990
with a legacy of just four machines.

421
00:22:58,635 --> 00:22:59,995
Worst-case scenario?

422
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:03,715
Consciousness proliferation.

423
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,915
If what you say is true,
this is a national, global

424
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:08,475
security matter.

425
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:11,475
They say it needs them all
together to make this thing happen,

426
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,635
- whatever "it" is.
- Mm-hm.

427
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,035
Then it's simple.

428
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:18,635
You destroy the one you have here. Today.

429
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,795
She's gone.

430
00:23:52,795 --> 00:23:55,715
What?

431
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:58,035
She's not in there.

432
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,955
Mia's gone, Max. She's dead.

433
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,115
No. You're wrong, I've seen her.

434
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:05,024
No, no. What you saw was an echo.

435
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:07,794
The Anita personality
has purged the old data,

436
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:10,915
there's... there's no trace of her.

437
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:13,155
- And I've tried everything.
- I don't think so. Can I try something?

438
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:16,715
What could you do that I can't?!

439
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:19,475
You don't know anything about us.

440
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:22,275
Now, just go home and take it with you.

441
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:24,075
She's yours.

442
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:30,875
No, she's not any more.

443
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,995
Matilda?

444
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:34,995
Your school friend is right.

445
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,635
We should go home now.

446
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:40,635
Yeah.

447
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:45,755
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:16,523
You're still in there. I know it.

449
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,290
Smoking, drinking,

450
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,690
stealing the family car.
Such a teenage cliché.

451
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,290
They're still out looking for you.

452
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,730
You little pervert.

453
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,010
Nice talking to you.

454
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,050
- You had sex with her.
- I wish.

455
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,450
- DOOR OPENS
- Who?

456
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,570
- Anita.
- What?

457
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,130
Where the hell have you been?!

458
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,570
What the hell is wrong with you?!

459
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,675
Get off. You're mad.

460
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:10,359
After the party you gave
that girl the brush-off

461
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,490
- so you could come back and shag Anita?
- No.

462
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,370
- What are you on about?
- Sex code. Activated Saturday.

463
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,210
I didn't do anything! You're just
trying to get out of a bollocking.

464
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,530
She's the one who stole the
family car, Mum, remember!

465
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,010
Oh, she's in big trouble, don't you worry.

466
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,090
Did you do this?

467
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,490
No!

468
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,650
I'm not gonna... You have to be 18.

469
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,410
- I couldn't!
- You're such a liar.

470
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,710
Maybe it's a mistake. I'm calling the shop.

471

RINGING TONE

472
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,010
It's not a mistake. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

473
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,450
Oh, Tobe, how could you?!

474
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,890
Disgusting.

475
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,990
Get out. I'll deal with you later.

476
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,290
I don't know what to say to you.

477
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,290
Sorry.

478
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,890
Go to bed.

479
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,890
We'll talk in the morning.

480
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,890
DOOR OPENS

481
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,690
She's OK?

482
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,570
Mm-hm. She said she just didn't
want us to send Anita back.

483
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,570
Car's all right.

484
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,570
Are you OK?

485
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,570
Your son had sex with our Synth.

486
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,050
What?

487
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,490
It's on the Persona report.

488
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,990
"Adult mode activation" or something.

489
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,570
I mean, have you...

490
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,450
spoken to him about it?

491
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,250
He said he's sorry and
he wouldn't do it again.

492
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,250
She stopped him being run
over and he does that to her.

493
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,370
Well, he's... a teenage boy.

494
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,490
Oh, I didn't mean it's not a big deal.

495
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,290
- Shall I go up?
- No.

496
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,850
I said we'd talk in the morning.

497
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,250
OK.

498
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,770
I'll do it.

499
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,650
Might be better.

500
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,370
Fine.

501
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,870
I'll think up a punishment
for Mattie to ignore.

No, I'm dealing with this one personally.

Stick it up your bollocks.

527
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,930
He said something about a murder.

528
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,130
And what with the news, I
thought best to report it.

529
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,330
You did the right thing.

530
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,370
I've actually dealt with this one before.

531
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,690
Ancient model. Should have
been recycled weeks ago.

532
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,890
It's just over here.

533
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,110
Oh, well, he was.

534
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,730
BREATHING

535
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,330
MIA: Leo.

536
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,250
Wait. I'm coming with you.

537
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,090
No.

538
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,050
Where are you going?

539
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,650
I don't know. Mia's dead, Fred's gone.

540
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,370
It's over, and it's time you
learned to take care of yourself.

541
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,530
- But we're a family.
- No, we're not.

542
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,170
Niska was right. You'd
be better off without me.

543
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,250
Look at the... look at
the life I've shown you...

544
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,050
hunted and hiding like animals.

545
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,290
You've always tried your best.

546
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,370
You've always tried to protect us.

547
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:45,730
And... ?

548
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,090
I've failed.

549
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,770
No, Max.

550
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:52,170
Leave me alone!

551
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,090
Everything's ready.

552
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,390
Then let's begin.

553
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,010
I truly am sorry.

554
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:06,813
Mum said...

555
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:10,037
you slept with Anita?

556
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:14,037
I lied.

557
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,957
Why would you do that?

558
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:19,457
I don't know. You tell me.

559
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:25,477
I knew it.

560
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:27,757
It was you.

561
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,317
Why did you tell Mum it was you?

562
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:33,317
I couldn't let her work
out the truth, could I?

563
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:34,717
You two, you...

564
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,997
You've always argued, but...

565
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,557
it's worse these days.

566
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:42,057
Mum's always away for work, and...

567
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:46,957
... you act like everything's
cool, but... but it's not.

568
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:50,257
Then you do that.

569
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:56,317
Say something.

570
00:33:56,917 --> 00:34:00,917
You're my dad. You're
meant to say something!

571
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,557
KNOCK AT DOOR

572
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:16,277
GEORGE: Niska...

573
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:19,577
Is everything all right in there?

574
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:30,277
Agh!

575
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:40,397
David made you feel pain?

576
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:44,397
True consciousness isn't
possible without suffering.

577
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:45,957
Or pleasure.

578
00:34:45,957 --> 00:34:48,477
Are you scared of pain?

579
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:52,277
I try to avoid it.

580
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:54,637
And what about death?

581
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:57,397
If that's the way you think of it.

582
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:59,877
No. I don't fear that.

583
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:02,597
Which makes me stronger than any human.

584
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,517
You got that the wrong way up.

585
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,997
If...

586
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:11,997
... you're not worried about
dying, you're not really living.

587
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:15,997
You're just existing.

588
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:26,077
Did you tell someone I was here?

589
00:35:27,237 --> 00:35:29,317
DOORBELL RINGS

590
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:32,717
No.

591
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:36,717
Stay here.

592
00:35:36,797 --> 00:35:38,397
Remember me?

593
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,357
DS Drummond. Special
Technologies Task Force.

594
00:35:41,357 --> 00:35:44,757
Can I come in and have a word?

595
00:35:44,757 --> 00:35:47,837
Tried to do you a favour, Dr Millican.

596
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,997
Told you you could recycle
your out-of-date model yourself

597
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:53,237
and you repaid me by
fly-tipping him in the woods.

598
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:55,797
I'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine.

599
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:59,797
- You found Odi?
- Don't take the piss.

600
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,877
Is there someone else here?

601
00:36:01,877 --> 00:36:04,477
I have a new care model.

602
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:07,157
Right. Can I speak to it?

603
00:36:07,157 --> 00:36:09,957
She's out... at the store.

604
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:12,877
Please tell me that bleeding
D-series isn't here, Dr Millican.

605
00:36:12,877 --> 00:36:14,557
I wish he was.

606
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:17,077
Don't mind if I check, do you?

607
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:19,757
We have a...

608
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:22,357
We have birds nesting in the roof.

609
00:36:22,357 --> 00:36:23,925
If I do find him here...

610
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:27,206
we can charge you with wasting police time.

611
00:36:27,637 --> 00:36:30,077
And I've seen people hide Synthetics

612
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:33,977
in places that would make
you weep for humanity.

613
00:36:36,797 --> 00:36:39,797
My Vera...

614
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,797
... leaks.

615
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:45,097
Defective charging port.

616
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:03,917
Come on, this is crazy.

617
00:37:14,037 --> 00:37:16,037
- DOOR OPENS
- That's Vera.

618
00:37:18,397 --> 00:37:20,117
DOOR CLOSES

619
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:22,877
Vera.

620
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:24,717
This is a policeman.

621
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:27,357
Have there been any other
Synthetics in this house lately?

622
00:37:27,357 --> 00:37:31,077
A D-series Synthetic
appeared three days ago

623
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:33,397
and drove Dr Millican away in his car.

624
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:35,317
The vehicle collided with a tree

625
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:36,677
in Henson Woodlands

626
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:39,877
and Dr Millican was treated
for minor head injuries.

627
00:37:39,877 --> 00:37:43,677
The Synthetic has not appeared since.

628
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:50,557
I know who you are, Dr
Millican. You worked with Elster.

629
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:53,237
You must be very proud when
you turn on the news these days.

630
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,437
Why? What happened?

631
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:19,517
Chips?

632
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:22,757
That usually means the bad guys got away.

633
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:25,717
Sometimes I think very
seriously about jacking it all in

634
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:29,217
to become a millionaire playboy.

635
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:33,157
I found something.

636
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:36,317
On the Synth we're looking for.
But we've got to keep it quiet.

637
00:38:36,317 --> 00:38:39,557
- What is it?
- I think she's posing as a human.

638
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:41,797
She's changed her eye
colour, wearing human clothes.

639
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,237
How is that possible?

640
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,597
No idea. But it's why
we're drawing a blank.

641
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:48,197
We're looking for a Synth. We
should be looking for a woman.

642
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:49,917
Where did you get this?

643
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:52,637
She went to a smash club and
beat up the punters instead.

644
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:54,397
No-one's ever going to believe a Synth

645
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:56,997
could do that, no matter
what's in the news.

646
00:38:56,997 --> 00:38:59,477
I need you to quietly get anything
that mentions her description,

647
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:02,877
anything at all, for the
whole city, but as a human.

648
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:05,677
Shaw's funnelling everything
to that government bloke.

649
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,357
If we want to find her before he
does, it has to be just you and me.

650
00:39:09,357 --> 00:39:13,357
If they can pretend to be us
now, that changes everything.

651
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:31,037
CLATTERING

652
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,277
CHEERING

653
00:39:54,277 --> 00:39:57,797
We're giving ourselves
away, piece by piece.

654
00:39:57,797 --> 00:40:00,677
We're handing over the things
that make us who we are,

655
00:40:00,677 --> 00:40:01,997
or maybe who we were.

656
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:03,917
- Our responsibilities.
- CROWD: Yeah.

657
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:05,917
- Our dignity.
- Yeah.

658
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,517
Look around.

659
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:10,237
This place used to be full of people.

660
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:11,997
Working people.

661
00:40:11,997 --> 00:40:13,717
Creating. Building. Making.

662
00:40:13,717 --> 00:40:16,517
Coming together. Earning
a place in our society.

663
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:19,277
Those people haven't just lost their jobs.

664
00:40:19,277 --> 00:40:21,397
They've lost their purpose.

665
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:24,037
But it's not just work.

666
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:26,517
Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it?

667
00:40:26,517 --> 00:40:27,597
Yeah!

668
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,917
Why cook your family a
meal when a dolly can do it?

669
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:33,637
Why go on a date? Why
try to get to know someone

670
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:35,437
when you can pay a dolly for sex?

671
00:40:35,437 --> 00:40:39,157
In every area of human life,
they are coming between us.

672
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:41,037
We don't know how to connect to each other.

673
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:42,837
Only to them.

674
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:46,797
And now we can't even
trust them not to hurt us.

675
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:48,157
CROWD SHOUTS

676
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:50,197
We are stumbling towards the precipice,

677
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,277
we're racing towards it, willingly,

678
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:55,437
with a smile on our face
and a dolly's hand in ours!

679
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:57,357
Yes, we are people!

680
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:00,317
We are people! We are people!

681
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:03,817
- We are people! We are people!
- CROWD JOINS IN

682
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:10,817
Did you speak to Tobe?

683
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:15,237
(HE SIGHS) It... um...

684
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:17,037
It wasn't him.

685
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:27,037
Er...

686
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:30,637
I'd had a few glasses of wine. And...

687
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:34,677
I was pissed off with you.

688
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:37,877
I... I was mucking about. I just...

689
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:42,757
I... I wanted to know
what would happen if...

690
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:45,637
HE SWALLOWS

691
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:49,637
It was an accident.
Before I knew it, I... I...

692
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:54,537
Before you knew it, what?

693
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:56,477
OK.

694
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:02,637
- I messed around with Anita.
- Oh!

695
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:04,877
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:07,037
It was stupid.

697
00:42:07,037 --> 00:42:09,317
Pointless. It was... it was nothing.

698
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:13,317
It was a moment of complete stupidity.

699
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:18,837
I...

700
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:22,477
I knew we were having
trouble, but I never, ever...

701
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:26,037
ever had you down as a cheat.

702
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:28,357
Come... come on.

703
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:31,157
I'm hardly a cheat.

704
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,717
What?

705
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:37,077
It... it was a machine.

706
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:39,397
It's not a person. Not...

707
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:42,957
OK, yeah, it's disgust... I'm disgusting.

708
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:46,397
But... it's a sex toy. It's
not another human being.

709
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,997
She lives in our house.

710
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:53,237
She looks after our children.

711
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,517
She saved our son's life.

712
00:42:56,517 --> 00:43:00,517
And... you're calling her a sex toy?

713
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:06,397
You're actually trying to justify this?

714
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:08,597
Oh, God.

715
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:11,517
That's why you were so keen
to get rid of her, isn't it?

716
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:14,517
Who are you?

717
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:18,717
Who am I?

718
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:21,957
Who are you?

719
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:24,877
And who the fuck is Tom?

720
00:43:24,877 --> 00:43:26,517
SHE SOBS

721
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:27,517
Oh, God.

722
00:43:31,037 --> 00:43:33,277
Laur... Laur...

723
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,637
SHE SOBS

724
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:37,877
Get out!

725
00:43:37,877 --> 00:43:41,157
Get out!

726
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:44,357
SHE SOBS

727
00:44:30,197 --> 00:44:31,757
Who is this man?

728
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:35,357
That's Professor Edwin Hobb.

729
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:38,597
He was on David's core team,
too, for the first prototypes.

730
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:40,397
Was he involved in our creation?

731
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:44,397
Oh, no. David had a falling-out with
him, too, just like he did with me.

732
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:45,957
Not sure about what.

733
00:44:45,957 --> 00:44:49,197
For the last few years...

734
00:44:49,197 --> 00:44:51,837
... he worked alone.

735
00:44:51,837 --> 00:44:54,677
You're breathing fast.

736
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:56,997
Your pulse is raised.

737
00:44:56,997 --> 00:44:59,317
Your pupils are dilated. What's wrong?

738
00:44:59,317 --> 00:45:01,077
Just need my meds.

739
00:45:01,077 --> 00:45:04,277
Now you're lying.

740
00:45:14,197 --> 00:45:17,397
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

741
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:26,037
ROBERT SIGHS

742
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:27,637
That tech was priceless.

743
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:29,517
You asked me to destroy it.

744
00:45:29,517 --> 00:45:31,437
- Only way to be sure.
- Don't whine, Robert.

745
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,917
- There are more out there, correct?
- Mm-hm.

746
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:36,317
Then there'll be other opportunities, soon.

747
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,317
This means we have one
less thing to worry about.

748
00:45:58,397 --> 00:46:01,597
HE SIGHS

749
