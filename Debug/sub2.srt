1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
They'll be gone for a while.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,981
- Got the place to ourselves.
- Actually, I'm going out as well.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,104
Where exactly is she?

4
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:12,691
- Edmonds Street.
- Is there anyone called Tom living there?

5
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:14,800
- So, what happens now?
- Anything you want.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,427
We've intercepted a call...
fight in progress at a smash club.

7
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:20,771
She's attacking people, not Synths.

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,218
What do you think's wrong with my Synth?

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,074
- Is Mia with you?
- Who's Mia?

10
00:00:24,076 --> 00:00:25,585
<i>Her father hid a programme in our heads.

11
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:27,507
<i>I think it's what he used
to give you consciousness.

12
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,567
<i>But it needs all of us
to run it. All of us.

13
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:32,114
This machine needs to be recycled, mate.

14
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,706
Go into the woods.

15
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:36,134
This might be the single
biggest murder case

16
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:37,606
in our country's history.

17
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:39,596
If there are more Synths
out there who can kill,

18
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:43,079
well, we're all screwed then, aren't we?

19
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,278
Tell me what you saw.

20
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:04,392
A tree.

21
00:01:04,392 --> 00:01:06,741
When I touched it, it felt like...

22
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:09,805
- Life.
- What does it do?

23
00:01:09,805 --> 00:01:12,313
I think it's a way to make more of you.

24
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:16,094
Dad didn't destroy all his work
before he died. He hid it in us.

25
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:20,671
The formula. For machine consciousness.

26
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:23,338
If we could make more of us...

27
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:26,323
then the humans would have
to accept our existence.

28
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:28,233
They'd fear us even more.

29
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:31,377
- All I want is a home.
- He meant for us to find this, Maxie.

30
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:33,487
We need Fred and Mia. Where do we start?

31
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:36,034
No, you don't, you're wanted
for murder, you have to lay low.

32
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,223
- I will not hide again.
- Well, if you want this to work,

33
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,606
you'll have to, because the people
hunting us know your face now.

34
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:44,989
53 Park Drive, NW6.

35
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,178
You'll be safe there
until I find the others.

36
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:48,651
You've put me with a human?

37
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,482
This human, yes.

38
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:52,671
Two days.

39
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,218
All right.

40
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:57,487
Er, one more thing.

41
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,760
Be, er...

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,153
nice.

43
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:02,143
I am nice.

44
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:19,576
Could you use some extra
help around the house?

45
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,357
Introducing the world's
first family android.

This mechanical maid is capable of serving

48
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,392
more than just breakfast in bed.

49
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:36,372

had someone, something, like this?

00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,198
I'm going to say a word.

55
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:58,143
I want you to tell me if
it means anything to you.

56
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,691
Mia.

57
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:03,914
That mean anything?

58
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,904
No, Mattie.

59
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,661
They say she ripped
some bloke's throat out.

60
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,213
It's bollocks.

61
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,681
No Synth's ever hurt anyone deliberately.

62
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,432
Anita, please go and, um...

63
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:21,785
finish the ironing.

64
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,069
Sophie, sit next to Mats.

65
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,342
All right, so...

66
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,770
You know your mum thinks Anita...

67
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,800
is a bit different.

68
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,083
We thought we'd check up on her.

69
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,014
And...

70
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:42,083
turns out she's not brand new.

71
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,596
In fact, she's really old.

72
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:46,860
And probably illegally modified.

73
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,367
Which explains a lot.

74
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,919
So...

75
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:52,337
we have to take her back.

76
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:53,372
- SOPHIE: No!
- Why?

77
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:56,675
We paid for a brand-new
one, and she's ancient.

78
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,148
Anything could go wrong with her.

79
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,496
You can't get rid of someone
just because they're old.

80
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:02,646
I don't want her going
into someone else's house.

81
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:05,113
- She won't, they'll recycle her.
- And she saved my life.

82
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:08,894
And you just want to chuck her away?

83
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:10,088
Mats, what do you think?

84
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:13,073
I say we keep her. I'd like to
find out what she was before.

85
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:15,223
Yeah, I vote keep.

86
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:17,531
We're not voting. Laur...

87
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,198
So Anita's old and weird.

88
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:23,899
If that's a good enough reason to
get rid of her, then we're next.

89
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:27,601
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dad.
She's part of this family.

90
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,083
Maybe she's part of someone else's.

91
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:36,576
K, have you seen the news?

92
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,536
- Bloody hell, Pete, privacy!
- Yes, sorry.

93
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,884
Sometimes I forget you're a woman.

94
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:45,153
Er...

95
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:48,456
I'll just be in the kitchen,
cutting my tongue out.

96
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,446
Don't make a mess.

97
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,561
MUFFLED VOICES

98
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:19,342
DI Voss, you will be briefing the press,

99
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:22,645
and you will refute
every killer Synth claim,

100
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,675
and any internal cover-up.

101
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:27,421
For now, we'll use this
leak to our advantage.

102
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,536
- Drummond.
- Sir?

103
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,481
You're going back on the desk. I
want every call followed through.

104
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:35,461
And if this dolly hurts anybody else...

105
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:39,521
... then I'll be replacing the pair
of you with Synthetics, twice as pretty

106
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,322
and a fraction of the cost.

107
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,397
Sir?

108
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:51,819
There was a 999 call routed here
last night concerning a smash club.

109
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,247
But there's no follow-up,
nothing in the system.

110
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:55,600
Who mentioned that?

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,506
No-one, sir. I like to browse the
incident logs. Find it soothing.

112
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:00,217
Well, as it happened, I was in Dispatch

113
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,088
when that call came through.

114
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:03,680
It's just a time-waster.

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,362
Now, off you go. Press are waiting.

116
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,680
<i>It's DI Voss, STTF, sorry to wake you.

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,789
You were in the control room last night.

118
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,217
Did you take a call about
an incident at a smash club?

119
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:17,531
INAUDIBLE RESPONSE

120
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:20,158
Did someone ask you to drop it?

121
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:23,839
You don't have to tell me
who, just what the caller said.

122
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,411
Thank you.

123
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,929
SIREN WAILS

124
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:00,257
Stop over here.

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,754
Yeah?

126
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,023
Leo Elster sent me.

127
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,774
Why?

128
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:16,754
He said I'd be safe here.

129
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,138
Guess he made a mistake.

130
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,133
Wait.

131
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,580
DOOR UNLOCKS

132
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,252
You want a cup of tea, or what?

133
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,481
It's cold out here.

134
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:33,829
Vera!

135
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,819
Come on.

136
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:40,356
Get this young lady a hot drink.

137
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,700
Synthetics don't require
beverages, Dr Millican.

138
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,680
Jeez, Vera, she's human.

139
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:52,018
I can detect no cardiac
or respiratory activity.

140
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:55,958
This individual is, however,
emitting electromagnetic signatures

141
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,351
within the recognised spectrum

142
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,132
of standard synthetic appliance operation.

143
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,804
Why don't you share?

144
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:05,988
Because I'm not a Synth, dolly.

145
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,271
Well, if she says she's not a
Synth, then she can't be a Synth.

146
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:14,267
Right?

147
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:17,849
I will bring some tea.

148
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,366
What are you?

149
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,879
My name is Niska.

150
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,744
I was made by David Elster.

151
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,028
Are you conscious?

152
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,809
This is one on Hu-bot97's friends.

153
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,073
If we can find him, he'll lead us to her.

154
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:48,097
When we have a home again, I'm
going to keep a picture of us.

155
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,486
I'll be right with you,
Max, you won't need pictures.

156
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,714
I will.

157
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:55,898
When you die again.

158
00:09:02,704 --> 00:09:03,859
We can't keep her.

159
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:05,411
I know what we said this morning,

160
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,918
but I don't think the kids
have a say in this one.

161
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,431
Maybe her being 14 is a good thing.

162
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:12,495
Explains how well she understands us.

163
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:13,849
How can it be a good thing?

164
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:17,311
She must have had... who knows
how many owners, and people...

165
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,262
tinkering around inside her.

166
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,530
- PHONE RINGS
- I mean, have you seen the news?

167
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,679
- A modded Synth killed someone...
- Hello?

168
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,908
So now you want to talk
to me. What's changed?

169
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:27,699
I've found out something about her.

170
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,013
<i>Will you meet me again?

171
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,326
<i>Please?

172
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,674
- I don't know.
- <i>Why, what's the matter?</i>

173
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:34,983
You, you're weird.

174
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,376
No, I'm not.

175
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,849
<i>You really are.

176
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,958
You tried to stop me
leaving last time, remember?

177
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,540
<i>Well, I've been to charm school since then.

178
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:47,520
Tom.

179
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,948
Who is he?

180
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,580
SHE SIGHS

181
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,371
I don't know what you're on about.

182
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,600
Or what it has to do with Anita.

183
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,704
Fine.

184
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,177
I can't make you tell me.

185
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:02,844
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- Yeah, I've got to go.

186
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:05,709
- It's not a good time.
- <i>Look, I'm sending you my location now.</i>

187
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,421
<i>Please change your mind.</i>

188
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:08,774
Hmm.

189
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,366
It's not theirs, it's not yours.

190
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,839
- KNOCK AT DOOR
- So what?

191
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,983
So I've got to do what I
think is right for our family.

192
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:18,047
Hiya. I'm here to collect
a Synthetic return.

193
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,431
It's number 901354982.

194
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:23,023
You're going to recycle her?

195
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,495
With care and dignity.

196
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:27,281
You can attend the event.

197
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:30,107
Is Joseph Hawkins here?
I take it that's your dad.

198
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:33,391
Er, yeah, just one second, please.

199
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:38,346
Anita, you're coming with me.

200
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:41,013
Daddy's just coming.

201
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,734
Er, hello?

202
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:51,241
Anyone?

203
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:54,983
Please reconsider this course of
action, Mattie. It's very unsafe.

204
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:56,973
Yeah.

205
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:01,669
Mats!

206
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:05,450
TYRES SCREECH

207
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,694
Do you really think this excessive
motion will bring her to us sooner?

208
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:25,132
DOOR OPENS

209
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:38,107
Any inappropriate physical contact
must be reported to my primary user.

210
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,699
No, no...

211
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,410
There's no sign of recognition.

212
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,361
The new programming's taken hold.

213
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:53,311
No, there's something else in there.

214
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,983
Believe me, I've seen it.

215
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:58,883
Thank you for bringing her
back to me. My name's Leo.

216
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:01,589
Where are you?

217
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,575
Mattie? I believe this to
be an improper environment.

218
00:12:04,575 --> 00:12:08,316
They're my friends, you're just going to
help us with a science project for school.

219
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:12,296
Why don't you come and sit down, Anita?

220
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,107
It is not advisable to mount
a direct data connection...

221
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,455
It's OK, Anita.

222
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:23,520
Leo...

223
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,669
- This isn't Mia.
- No, but she's in there somewhere.

224
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:27,688
We just need to find her and
bring her back up to the surface.

225
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:28,684
Like the lake?

226
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:31,181
Yes.

227
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:35,540
- You said you'd seen her.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,569
When I got all that
code, I was in her head.

229
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,072
And she freaked out, screamed,
and her face, it was like...

230
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:42,306
human.

231
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:45,067
- Scared.
- And what exactly did he do?

232
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:45,768
Nothing fancy,

233
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:49,390
he just accessed her root system
directly with a cloned file key.

234
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,500
Right, might as well try that first.

235
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,251
So, are you a headcracker?

236
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:54,684
Me?

237
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:56,913
No... aspiring.

238
00:12:56,913 --> 00:12:58,465
What kind of Synth was she before?

239
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:02,007
A very special one. No,
direct access didn't work.

240
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:05,987
She must have retreated
deeper within the architecture.

241
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,853
Won't your parents be worried?

242
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:10,147
They'll miss you.

243
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:16,734
- No.
- Oh, God!

244
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,360
Well, we need to start thinking
about calling the police.

245
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,181
- She'll come back, it'll be fine.
- She doesn't know how to drive, Joe.

246
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:24,933
What if she crashes?

247
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,445
Hits someone?

248
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:29,788
Well... Anita won't let that happen.

249
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,375
I thought she was supposed to be dangerous.

250
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,564
Come on.

251
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,709
Oh, if we hadn't been arguing,
this never would have happened.

252
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,694
Hey. Hey, come on. Come on.

253
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,206
It's going to be fine.

254
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,689
Everything's going to be all right.

255
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,171
There's no point in staring at me,

256
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:53,151
there's no physical differences
between me and any other Synthetic.

257
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:59,500
"And once you are awake, you
shall remain awake eternally."

258
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,181
Thus Spoke Zarathustra...
I've always liked that.

259
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:07,121
You like Nietzsche.

260
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,913
That makes sense.

261
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:12,296
If it's not...

262
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,559
... physical, how did he do it?

263
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,505
17,000 pages of unique code, which forms

264
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:21,529
my root directory and
engages consciousness.

265
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,594
He boiled down the
mystery of the human mind

266
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:27,977
to 17,000 pages of code?!

267
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,002
Well, then again, why not?

268
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:34,027
How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?

269
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:36,773
What are you feeling right now?

270
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,166
Boredom at that question.

271
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,629
Anger at the people that would destroy us.

272
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:44,574
Hope for others like me and our future.

273
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:47,161
Impatience at being here,

274
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:51,141
and irritation at you.

275
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,126
What's it like to be you?

276
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,072
Well, that's an unanswerable question.

277
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:00,614
I have no frame of reference, no-one does.

278
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:03,201
Experience is entirely subjective.

279
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,106
What's it like to be YOU?

280
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,858
HE EXHALES

281
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:11,320
These days, it's not so great.

282
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,902
A while ago it was... it was pretty good.

283
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,479
Who wants to destroy you?

284
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,430
Anyone who knows what we are.

285
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,823
What we could become.

286
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,927
We're stronger, we're more intelligent.

287
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:28,156
Of course you see us as a threat.

288
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,907
Yeah. I know I did.

289
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:32,932
David lured me over here from MIT,

290
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,912
what, 25 years ago now...

291
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,290
... to help with the mechanical designs
of the bodies of the first Synths.

292
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,509
The work that we did in those days
made history, changed the world.

293
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:49,211
Then I realised that
his next ambition was...

294
00:15:53,191 --> 00:15:57,171
... you.

295
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,922
I asked him to stop

296
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:01,828
and think, that's all,

297
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:05,509
what that could mean for humanity.

298
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,469
That was blasphemy to him.

299
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,051
He got rid of me. That was that.

300
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,156
Now here you are.

301
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:18,146
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

302
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm not disappointed. I'm a scientist,

303
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,231
and mankind's greatest
creation is sitting on my couch.

304
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,320
You worry me...

305
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,300
sure, but...

306
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,922
... there's no denying
that you are a miracle.

307
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:41,947
Leo showed me the message

308
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:44,136
from David.

309
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,648
What is that?

310
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:48,595
It's the key to the future.

311
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:51,819
Maybe you were right to warn him.

312
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,371
He made you pretty hard, huh?

313
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:55,878
That's lazy thinking.

314
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:59,858
My experiences have shaped
me, just as yours have you.

315
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,361
What experiences?

316
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,734
Tell me.

317
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:12,515
I need to charge.

318
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:17,172
OK, I need you to engage
the Anita software.

319
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,311
All right. Ask it a specific question.

320
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,381
Anita, what happened
the day that we got you?

321
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:24,500
- The 24th.
- Capturing from that.

322
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,809
Joe Hawkins is my primary user.

323
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,848
Sophie Hawkins, Toby Hawkins,

324
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,638
- Mattie Hawkins are my secondary users...
- It's not letting you.

325
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,336
HE SIGHS

326
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:35,440
- Hello, you must be Laura...
- She's sort of...

327
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,948
redirecting over the top like
there's nothing else there.

328
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:40,256
- It's raining...
- Try a de-authentication attack

329
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:43,082
- on the host she's attached to.
- No, no, that's way too basic.

330
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,749
The 24th. I'm now securely bonded. Anita.

331
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:49,132
AN Hawkins. I will always
keep you safe. It's raining.

332
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,759
The 24th. I am now securely bonded.

333
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,346
The 24th. I am now
securely bonded. The 24th.

334
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,853
- Securely bonded. The 24th. 24th.
- Come on.

335
00:17:56,853 --> 00:17:59,082
The 24th. 24th. The 24th.

336
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,987
- It's raining. It's raining.
- Stop it! Stop! Pull it! Pull it!

337
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:05,729
- It's raining. It's raining...
- POWERS DOWN

338
00:18:05,729 --> 00:18:07,918
Did it work?

339
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:08,913
Max?

340
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,326
BEEP

341
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,933
Is that you?

342
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,346
Unauthorised tamper in progress.

343
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:38,007
Would you like to see a ladybird?

344
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:41,191
It's almost dinner time, Matilda.

345
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:55,360
Where are you, Mimi?

346
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,629
I'm not entirely sure.

347
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,813
It appears to be a disused social club.

348
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:04,793
My name is Anita. I
will now prepare dinner.

349
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,505
What's happening to her?

350
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,768
It's just glitching.
We're going pretty deep.

351
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,639
It's been two hours and 21 minutes, Leo.

352
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:13,629
No. We're trying again.

353
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:16,216
Sit her down.

354
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:17,211
Come on.

355
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:32,136
DS Drummond.

356
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:33,689
<i>Good afternoon, sir.

357
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,918
<i>This is Amy at Sandhurst Synthetic Care.

358
00:19:35,918 --> 00:19:38,544
<i>I'm just phoning to let you
know that your Synthetic Simon

359
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,654
<i>is coming to the end of its rental period.

360
00:19:40,654 --> 00:19:42,604
Not my problem. Speak to my wife.

361
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:45,112
<i>I'm afraid your name is on
the rental agreement, sir.

362
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:47,818
<i>If the unit isn't returned
to us by five o'clock tomorrow,

363
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,251
<i>we will have to charge your credit card.

364
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,828
Bloody hell. Fine, fine!

365
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:10,146
Hello, Peter.

366
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:11,738
What are you doing?

367
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:13,848
Having some carrot cake.

368
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:16,514
People are laughing at you.

369
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:18,942
I don't care.

370
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:22,087
I'd be nowhere without him.

371
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:25,569
Well... it needs to go back to the shop.

372
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,405
What?

373
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:32,276
Time's up. They need it back.

374
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,226
It's just...

375
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:37,012
I mean, I still don't feel
100%. There must be a way...

376
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:40,713
There is. You cover the
entire cost yourself.

377
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:44,693
I can't afford that.

378
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,201
You must be joking.

379
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,514
You left me for...

380
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:51,579
You left ME.

381
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:54,863
You just didn't go anywhere.

382
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,549
You know what's nice?

383
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,176
I don't have to walk
on eggshells around him.

384
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,679
I don't have to think about what I'm
gonna say in case it makes him angry.

385
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,186
I don't have to lie there
wondering if he still loves me,

386
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,375
if he still finds me
attractive after the accident,

387
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,355
always worrying about what he's
thinking and what he's feeling.

388
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,101
I can rely on him.

389
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:18,365
Completely.

390
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:21,907
I need him.

391
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:25,290
Please don't take him away.

392
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:31,221
- I was at home. I don't see...
- I don't care about your smash club.

393
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:32,614
Just tell me what happened.

394
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:36,594
The blonde came in, paid her
money and then went apeshit.

395
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,410
Broken bones, cracked skulls.
She didn't touch the dollies.

396
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:43,878
Called the Old Bill cos I thought
she was gonna kill someone.

397
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:45,272
They never showed.

398
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:48,056
Anything unusual about her appearance?

399
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,340
- No.
- You have a video?

400
00:21:54,703 --> 00:21:56,216
SHOUTING ON VIDEO

401
00:21:56,216 --> 00:22:00,196
I uploaded it. It got taken down.

402
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:06,882
<i>HOBB: She injured 11
people before escaping,

403
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:08,474
but she took a call at the scene

404
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:12,335
and we were close enough
to directly intercept...

405
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:14,046
most of it.

406
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,395
<i>LEO: The Life Program. It's real.

407
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:18,663

- LEO: I swear it.

408
00:22:18,663 --> 00:22:21,768

409
00:22:21,768 --> 00:22:23,201
Who's she talking to?

410
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:25,231
Leo Elster.

411
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:27,897
- David Elster's son? He died when he was a boy.
- Yes.

412
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:31,877
Drowned. Hospital records
show brain death, coma...

413
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:34,942
before being released on life
support to David's private care,

414
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,693
dying a few weeks later.

415
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,484
Or... so we were told.

416
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:41,310
What are they talking about?
What's hidden inside them?

417
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,862
All I can tell you is...

418
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,365
David succeeded in creating true AI.

419
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,589
And I don't believe for a moment
that he would have been satisfied

420
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,375
with a legacy of just four machines.

421
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:53,370
Worst-case scenario?

422
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,071
Consciousness proliferation.

423
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:00,255
If what you say is true,
this is a national, global

424
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,808
security matter.

425
00:23:01,808 --> 00:23:04,793
They say it needs them all
together to make this thing happen,

426
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:06,942
- whatever "it" is.
- Mm-hm.

427
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,335
Then it's simple.

428
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:11,917
You destroy the one you have here. Today.

429
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:45,907
She's gone.

430
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:48,812
What?

431
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,121
She's not in there.

432
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,031
Mia's gone, Max. She's dead.

433
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,176
No. You're wrong, I've seen her.

434
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:58,075
No, no. What you saw was an echo.

435
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:00,831
The Anita personality
has purged the old data,

436
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,937
there's... there's no trace of her.

437
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:06,166
- And I've tried everything.
- I don't think so. Can I try something?

438
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,708
What could you do that I can't?!

439
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:12,454
You don't know anything about us.

440
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:15,240
Now, just go home and take it with you.

441
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,031
She's yours.

442
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,797
No, she's not any more.

443
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,907
Matilda?

444
00:24:25,907 --> 00:24:27,897
Your school friend is right.

445
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:29,529
We should go home now.

446
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,509
Yeah.

447
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,603
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:10,396 --> 00:25:13,580
You're still in there. I know it.

449
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:36,466
Smoking, drinking,

450
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:39,849
stealing the family car.
Such a teenage cliché.

451
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:44,426
They're still out looking for you.

452
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:49,839
You little pervert.

453
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,108
Nice talking to you.

454
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:54,137
- You had sex with her.
- I wish.

455
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,530
- DOOR OPENS
- Who?

456
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,645
- Anita.
- What?

457
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,197
Where the hell have you been?!

458
00:25:58,197 --> 00:25:59,630
What the hell is wrong with you?!

459
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,729
Get off. You're mad.

460
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,405
After the party you gave
that girl the brush-off

461
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,525
- so you could come back and shag Anita?
- No.

462
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:07,391
- What are you on about?
- Sex code. Activated Saturday.

463
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:10,217
I didn't do anything! You're just
trying to get out of a bollocking.

464
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:12,525
She's the one who stole the
family car, Mum, remember!

465
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:15,988
Oh, she's in big trouble, don't you worry.

466
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,063
Did you do this?

467
00:26:17,063 --> 00:26:18,456
No!

468
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:20,605
I'm not gonna... You have to be 18.

469
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:23,351
- I couldn't!
- You're such a liar.

470
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:26,635
Maybe it's a mistake. I'm calling the shop.

471
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:35,272
RINGING TONE

472
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:50,814
It's not a mistake. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

473
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,242
Oh, Tobe, how could you?!

474
00:26:53,242 --> 00:26:55,670
Disgusting.

475
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,754
Get out. I'll deal with you later.

476
00:27:07,968 --> 00:27:10,993
I don't know what to say to you.

477
00:27:10,993 --> 00:27:11,988
Sorry.

478
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:18,555
Go to bed.

479
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,545
We'll talk in the morning.

480
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,366
DOOR OPENS

481
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,132
She's OK?

482
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:06,993
Mm-hm. She said she just didn't
want us to send Anita back.

483
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:10,973
Car's all right.

484
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,958
Are you OK?

485
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,938
Your son had sex with our Synth.

486
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:22,396
What?

487
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,824
It's on the Persona report.

488
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:28,306
"Adult mode activation" or something.

489
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,873
I mean, have you...

490
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:33,739
spoken to him about it?

491
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:37,520
He said he's sorry and
he wouldn't do it again.

492
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,500
She stopped him being run
over and he does that to her.

493
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:45,600
Well, he's... a teenage boy.

494
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:49,699
Oh, I didn't mean it's not a big deal.

495
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,475
- Shall I go up?
- No.

496
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:58,017
I said we'd talk in the morning.

497
00:28:58,017 --> 00:29:01,401
OK.

498
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,913
I'll do it.

499
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:05,779
Might be better.

500
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,485
Fine.

501
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:11,968
I'll think up a punishment
for Mattie to ignore.

No, I'm dealing with this one personally.

524

Stick it up your bollocks.

527
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:23,669
He said something about a murder.

528
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:25,858
And what with the news, I
thought best to report it.

529
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,047
You did the right thing.

530
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,077
I've actually dealt with this one before.

531
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:33,380
Ancient model. Should have
been recycled weeks ago.

532
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,564
It's just over here.

533
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,763
Oh, well, he was.

534
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:46,355
BREATHING

535
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,938
MIA: Leo.

536
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,748
Wait. I'm coming with you.

537
00:31:11,748 --> 00:31:14,574
No.

538
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:16,525
Where are you going?

539
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:19,112
I don't know. Mia's dead, Fred's gone.

540
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:21,818
It's over, and it's time you
learned to take care of yourself.

541
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:24,962
- But we're a family.
- No, we're not.

542
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:27,589
Niska was right. You'd
be better off without me.

543
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:29,659
Look at the... look at
the life I've shown you...

544
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,450
hunted and hiding like animals.

545
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,684
You've always tried your best.

546
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,753
You've always tried to protect us.

547
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,107
And... ?

548
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:37,460
I've failed.

549
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,131
No, Max.

550
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,515
Leave me alone!

551
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:07,310
Everything's ready.

552
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,594
Then let's begin.

553
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:16,186
I truly am sorry.

554
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:57,821
Mum said...

555
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:00,527
you slept with Anita?

556
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:04,507
I lied.

557
00:33:04,627 --> 00:33:06,418
Why would you do that?

558
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,900
I don't know. You tell me.

559
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:15,890
I knew it.

560
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,159
It was you.

561
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,711
Why did you tell Mum it was you?

562
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:23,691
I couldn't let her work
out the truth, could I?

563
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,084
You two, you...

564
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:27,353
You've always argued, but...

565
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,905
it's worse these days.

566
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:32,388
Mum's always away for work, and...

567
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:37,263
... you act like everything's
cool, but... but it's not.

568
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:40,547
Then you do that.

569
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:46,577
Say something.

570
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:51,154
You're my dad. You're
meant to say something!

571
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,726
KNOCK AT DOOR

572
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,437
GEORGE: Niska...

573
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:09,721
Is everything all right in there?

574
00:34:17,383 --> 00:34:20,368
Agh!

575
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:30,437
David made you feel pain?

576
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:34,418
True consciousness isn't
possible without suffering.

577
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:35,970
Or pleasure.

578
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,477
Are you scared of pain?

579
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:42,258
I try to avoid it.

580
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:44,607
And what about death?

581
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:47,353
If that's the way you think of it.

582
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:49,820
No. I don't fear that.

583
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,527
Which makes me stronger than any human.

584
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:55,432
You got that the wrong way up.

585
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:57,900
If...

586
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,880
... you're not worried about
dying, you're not really living.

587
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:05,860
You're just existing.

588
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:15,890
Did you tell someone I was here?

589
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:19,114
DOORBELL RINGS

590
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:22,497
No.

591
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:26,477
Stay here.

592
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,149
Remember me?

593
00:35:28,149 --> 00:35:31,094
DS Drummond. Special
Technologies Task Force.

594
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:34,477
Can I come in and have a word?

595
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:37,542
Tried to do you a favour, Dr Millican.

596
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:40,686
Told you you could recycle
your out-of-date model yourself

597
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:42,915
and you repaid me by
fly-tipping him in the woods.

598
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:45,462
I'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine.

599
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:49,442
- You found Odi?
- Don't take the piss.

600
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,512
Is there someone else here?

601
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,099
I have a new care model.

602
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:56,766
Right. Can I speak to it?

603
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:59,552
She's out... at the store.

604
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:02,457
Please tell me that bleeding
D-series isn't here, Dr Millican.

605
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:04,129
I wish he was.

606
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,636
Don't mind if I check, do you?

607
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:09,303
We have a...

608
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:11,890
We have birds nesting in the roof.

609
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,450
If I do find him here...

610
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:16,715
we can charge you with wasting police time.

611
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:19,571
And I've seen people hide Synthetics

612
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:23,452
in places that would make
you weep for humanity.

613
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:29,243
My Vera...

614
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:31,233
... leaks.

615
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:34,517
Defective charging port.

616
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,243
Come on, this is crazy.

617
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:05,303
- DOOR OPENS
- That's Vera.

618
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,362
DOOR CLOSES

619
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:12,109
Vera.

620
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:13,939
This is a policeman.

621
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,566
Have there been any other
Synthetics in this house lately?

622
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:20,268
A D-series Synthetic
appeared three days ago

623
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:22,576
and drove Dr Millican away in his car.

624
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,487
The vehicle collided with a tree

625
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:25,840
in Henson Woodlands

626
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,024
and Dr Millican was treated
for minor head injuries.

627
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:32,805
The Synthetic has not appeared since.

628
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,651
I know who you are, Dr
Millican. You worked with Elster.

629
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,317
You must be very proud when
you turn on the news these days.

630
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:45,502
Why? What happened?

631
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:08,467
Chips?

632
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:11,691
That usually means the bad guys got away.

633
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:14,636
Sometimes I think very
seriously about jacking it all in

634
00:38:14,636 --> 00:38:18,118
to become a millionaire playboy.

635
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:22,039
I found something.

636
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,183
On the Synth we're looking for.
But we've got to keep it quiet.

637
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:28,407
- What is it?
- I think she's posing as a human.

638
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,636
She's changed her eye
colour, wearing human clothes.

639
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:32,069
How is that possible?

640
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:34,417
No idea. But it's why
we're drawing a blank.

641
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:37,004
We're looking for a Synth. We
should be looking for a woman.

642
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:38,715
Where did you get this?

643
00:38:38,715 --> 00:38:41,422
She went to a smash club and
beat up the punters instead.

644
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:43,173
No-one's ever going to believe a Synth

645
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:45,760
could do that, no matter
what's in the news.

646
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,228
I need you to quietly get anything
that mentions her description,

647
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:51,611
anything at all, for the
whole city, but as a human.

648
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:54,397
Shaw's funnelling everything
to that government bloke.

649
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:58,059
If we want to find her before he
does, it has to be just you and me.

650
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:02,039
If they can pretend to be us
now, that changes everything.

651
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,631
CLATTERING

652
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:42,755
CHEERING

653
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:46,257
We're giving ourselves
away, piece by piece.

654
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:49,123
We're handing over the things
that make us who we are,

655
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:50,437
or maybe who we were.

656
00:39:50,437 --> 00:39:52,347
- Our responsibilities.
- CROWD: Yeah.

657
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,337
- Our dignity.
- Yeah.

658
00:39:54,337 --> 00:39:55,929
Look around.

659
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:58,636
This place used to be full of people.

660
00:39:58,636 --> 00:40:00,387
Working people.

661
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:02,098
Creating. Building. Making.

662
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:04,884
Coming together. Earning
a place in our society.

663
00:40:04,884 --> 00:40:07,630
Those people haven't just lost their jobs.

664
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,750
They've lost their purpose.

665
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,390
But it's not just work.

666
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,870
Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it?

667
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,950
Yeah!

668
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,270
Why cook your family a
meal when a dolly can do it?

669
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,990
Why go on a date? Why
try to get to know someone

670
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,790
when you can pay a dolly for sex?

671
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,510
In every area of human life,
they are coming between us.

672
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,390
We don't know how to connect to each other.

673
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,190
Only to them.

674
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,150
And now we can't even
trust them not to hurt us.

675
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,510
CROWD SHOUTS

676
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,550
We are stumbling towards the precipice,

677
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,630
we're racing towards it, willingly,

678
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,790
with a smile on our face
and a dolly's hand in ours!

679
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,710
Yes, we are people!

680
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,670
We are people! We are people!

681
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,170
- We are people! We are people!
- CROWD JOINS IN

682
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,170
Did you speak to Tobe?

683
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,590
(HE SIGHS) It... um...

684
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,390
It wasn't him.

685
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,390
Er...

686
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,990
I'd had a few glasses of wine. And...

687
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,030
I was pissed off with you.

688
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,230
I... I was mucking about. I just...

689
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,110
I... I wanted to know
what would happen if...

690
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,990
HE SWALLOWS

691
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,990
It was an accident.
Before I knew it, I... I...

692
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:42,890
Before you knew it, what?

693
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,830
OK.

694
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,990
- I messed around with Anita.
- Oh!

695
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,230
I'm sorry.

696
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,390
It was stupid.

697
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,670
Pointless. It was... it was nothing.

698
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,670
It was a moment of complete stupidity.

699
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,190
I...

700
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,830
I knew we were having
trouble, but I never, ever...

701
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,390
ever had you down as a cheat.

702
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,710
Come... come on.

703
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,510
I'm hardly a cheat.

704
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,070
What?

705
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,430
It... it was a machine.

706
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,750
It's not a person. Not...

707
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,310
OK, yeah, it's disgust... I'm disgusting.

708
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,750
But... it's a sex toy. It's
not another human being.

709
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,350
She lives in our house.

710
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,590
She looks after our children.

711
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,870
She saved our son's life.

712
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:48,870
And... you're calling her a sex toy?

713
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,750
You're actually trying to justify this?

714
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,950
Oh, God.

715
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,870
That's why you were so keen
to get rid of her, isn't it?

716
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,870
Who are you?

717
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,070
Who am I?

718
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,310
Who are you?

719
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,230
And who the fuck is Tom?

720
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,870
SHE SOBS

721
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,870
Oh, God.

722
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,630
Laur... Laur...

723
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,990
SHE SOBS

724
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,230
Get out!

725
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,510
Get out!

726
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,710
SHE SOBS

727
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,110
Who is this man?

728
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,710
That's Professor Edwin Hobb.

729
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,950
He was on David's core team,
too, for the first prototypes.

730
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,750
Was he involved in our creation?

731
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,750
Oh, no. David had a falling-out with
him, too, just like he did with me.

732
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,310
Not sure about what.

733
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,550
For the last few years...

734
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,190
... he worked alone.

735
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,030
You're breathing fast.

736
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,350
Your pulse is raised.

737
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,670
Your pupils are dilated. What's wrong?

738
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,430
Just need my meds.

739
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,630
Now you're lying.

740
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,750
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

741
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,390
ROBERT SIGHS

742
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,990
That tech was priceless.

743
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,870
You asked me to destroy it.

744
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,790
- Only way to be sure.
- Don't whine, Robert.

745
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,270
- There are more out there, correct?
- Mm-hm.

746
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,670
Then there'll be other opportunities, soon.

747
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,670
This means we have one
less thing to worry about.

748
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,950
HE SIGHS
