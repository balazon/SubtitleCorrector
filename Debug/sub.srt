1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
They'll be gone for a while.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,981
- Got the place to ourselves.
- Actually, I'm going out as well.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,110
Where exactly is she?

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,710
- Edmonds Street.
- Is there anyone called Tom living there?

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,830
- So, what happens now?
- Anything you want.

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,470
We've intercepted a call...
fight in progress at a smash club.

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,830
She's attacking people, not Synths.

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,285
What do you think's wrong with my Synth?

9
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:19,150
- Is Mia with you?
- Who's Mia?

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,669
<i>Her father hid a programme in our heads.

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,600
<i>I think it's what he used
to give you consciousness.

12
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
<i>But it needs all of us
to run it. All of us.

13
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,230
This machine needs to be recycled, mate.

14
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,830
Go into the woods.

15
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,270
This might be the single
biggest murder case

16
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,750
in our country's history.

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
If there are more Synths
out there who can kill,

18
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,250
well, we're all screwed then, aren't we?

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,550
Tell me what you saw.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,670
A tree.

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,030
When I touched it, it felt like...

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,110
- Life.
- What does it do?

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,630
I think it's a way to make more of you.

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,430
Dad didn't destroy all his work
before he died. He hid it in us.

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,030
The formula. For machine consciousness.

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,710
If we could make more of us...

27
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,710
then the humans would have
to accept our existence.

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,630
They'd fear us even more.

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,790
- All I want is a home.
- He meant for us to find this, Maxie.

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,910
We need Fred and Mia. Where do we start?

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,470
No, you don't, you're wanted
for murder, you have to lay low.

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,670
- I will not hide again.
- Well, if you want this to work,

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,070
you'll have to, because the people
hunting us know your face now.

34
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,470
53 Park Drive, NW6.

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,670
You'll be safe there
until I find the others.

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,150
You've put me with a human?

37
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,990
This human, yes.

38
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,190
Two days.

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,750
All right.

40
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,030
Er, one more thing.

41
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,310
Be, er...

42
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,710
nice.

43
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,710
I am nice.

44
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,230
Could you use some extra
help around the house?

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,030
Introducing the world's
first family android.

This mechanical maid is capable of serving

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,110
more than just breakfast in bed.

49
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,110

had someone, something, like this?

I'm going to say a word.

55

I want you to tell me if
it means anything to you.

56
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,550
Mia.

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,790
That mean anything?

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,790
No, Mattie.

59
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,590
They say she ripped
some bloke's throat out.

60
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,150
It's bollocks.

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,630
No Synth's ever hurt anyone deliberately.

62
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,390
Anita, please go and, um...

63
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,750
finish the ironing.

64
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,050
Sophie, sit next to Mats.

65
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,350
All right, so...

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,790
You know your mum thinks Anita...

67
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,830
is a bit different.

68
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,130
We thought we'd check up on her.

69
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,070
And...

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,150
turns out she's not brand new.

71
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,670
In fact, she's really old.

72
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,950
And probably illegally modified.

73
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,470
Which explains a lot.

74
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,030
So...

75
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,455
we have to take her back.

76
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:49,495
- SOPHIE: No!
- Why?

77
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,815
We paid for a brand-new
one, and she's ancient.

78
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,295
Anything could go wrong with her.

79
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:56,655
You can't get rid of someone
just because they're old.

80
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,815
I don't want her going
into someone else's house.

81
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,295
- She won't, they'll recycle her.
- And she saved my life.

82
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:05,095
And you just want to chuck her away?

83
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,295
Mats, what do you think?

84
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:09,295
I say we keep her. I'd like to
find out what she was before.

85
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,455
Yeah, I vote keep.

86
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,775
We're not voting. Laur...

87
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:16,455
So Anita's old and weird.

88
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:20,175
If that's a good enough reason to
get rid of her, then we're next.

89
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:23,895
Yeah, I'm sorry, Dad.
She's part of this family.

90
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:27,395
Maybe she's part of someone else's.

91
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,915
K, have you seen the news?

92
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,895
- Bloody hell, Pete, privacy!
- Yes, sorry.

93
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,255
Sometimes I forget you're a woman.

94
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:41,535
Er...

95
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:44,855
I'll just be in the kitchen,
cutting my tongue out.

96
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,855
Don't make a mess.

97
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:04,055
MUFFLED VOICES

98
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:15,895
DI Voss, you will be briefing the press,

99
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:19,215
and you will refute
every killer Synth claim,

100
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,255
and any internal cover-up.

101
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:24,015
For now, we'll use this
leak to our advantage.

102
00:05:24,015 --> 00:05:25,135
- Drummond.
- Sir?

103
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:28,095
You're going back on the desk. I
want every call followed through.

104
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:32,095
And if this dolly hurts anybody else...

105
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:36,175
... then I'll be replacing the pair
of you with Synthetics, twice as pretty

106
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:39,995
and a fraction of the cost.

107
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,095
Sir?

108
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,535
There was a 999 call routed here
last night concerning a smash club.

109
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,975
But there's no follow-up,
nothing in the system.

110
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,335
Who mentioned that?

111
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:55,255
No-one, sir. I like to browse the
incident logs. Find it soothing.

112
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,975
Well, as it happened, I was in Dispatch

113
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,855
when that call came through.

114
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,455
It's just a time-waster.

115
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:04,155
Now, off you go. Press are waiting.

116
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,495
<i>It's DI Voss, STTF, sorry to wake you.

117
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,615
You were in the control room last night.

118
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,055
Did you take a call about
an incident at a smash club?

119
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,375
INAUDIBLE RESPONSE

120
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,015
Did someone ask you to drop it?

121
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:20,715
You don't have to tell me
who, just what the caller said.

122
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,335
Thank you.

123
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,935
SIREN WAILS

124
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,315
Stop over here.

125
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:05,855
Yeah?

126
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:08,135
Leo Elster sent me.

127
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,895
Why?

128
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:13,895
He said I'd be safe here.

129
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,295
Guess he made a mistake.

130
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,295
Wait.

131
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,775
DOOR UNLOCKS

132
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,455
You want a cup of tea, or what?

133
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,695
It's cold out here.

134
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:31,055
Vera!

135
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,055
Come on.

136
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,615
Get this young lady a hot drink.

137
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,975
Synthetics don't require
beverages, Dr Millican.

138
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,975
Jeez, Vera, she's human.

139
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:49,335
I can detect no cardiac
or respiratory activity.

140
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,295
This individual is, however,
emitting electromagnetic signatures

141
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:54,695
within the recognised spectrum

142
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:58,495
of standard synthetic appliance operation.

143
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:00,175
Why don't you share?

144
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:03,375
Because I'm not a Synth, dolly.

145
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:10,694
Well, if she says she's not a
Synth, then she can't be a Synth.

146
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:11,695
Right?

147
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:15,295
I will bring some tea.

148
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,855
What are you?

149
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:25,375
My name is Niska.

150
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,255
I was made by David Elster.

151
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,555
Are you conscious?

152
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,375
This is one on Hu-bot97's friends.

153
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,655
If we can find him, he'll lead us to her.

154
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,695
When we have a home again, I'm
going to keep a picture of us.

155
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:48,095
I'll be right with you,
Max, you won't need pictures.

156
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,335
I will.

157
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:53,535
When you die again.

158
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,535
We can't keep her.

159
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,095
I know what we said this morning,

160
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,615
but I don't think the kids
have a say in this one.

161
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,135
Maybe her being 14 is a good thing.

162
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,215
Explains how well she understands us.

163
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,575
How can it be a good thing?

164
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:15,055
She must have had... who knows
how many owners, and people...

165
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,015
tinkering around inside her.

166
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,295
- PHONE RINGS
- I mean, have you seen the news?

167
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,455
- A modded Synth killed someone...
- Hello?

168
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,695
So now you want to talk
to me. What's changed?

169
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,495
I've found out something about her.

170
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:26,815
<i>Will you meet me again?

171
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:28,135
<i>Please?

172
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,495
- I don't know.
- <i>Why, what's the matter?</i>

173
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,815
You, you're weird.

174
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:34,215
No, I'm not.

175
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,695
<i>You really are.

176
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,815
You tried to stop me
leaving last time, remember?

177
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:41,415
<i>Well, I've been to charm school since then.

178
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:45,415
Tom.

179
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,855
Who is he?

180
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,495
SHE SIGHS

181
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:51,295
I don't know what you're on about.

182
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:53,535
Or what it has to do with Anita.

183
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:56,655
Fine.

184
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,135
I can't make you tell me.

185
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,815
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- Yeah, I've got to go.

186
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,695
- It's not a good time.
- <i>Look, I'm sending you my location now.</i>

187
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,415
<i>Please change your mind.</i>

188
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:06,775
Hmm.

189
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,375
It's not theirs, it's not yours.

190
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,855
- KNOCK AT DOOR
- So what?

191
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:13,015
So I've got to do what I
think is right for our family.

192
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,095
Hiya. I'm here to collect
a Synthetic return.

193
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:19,495
It's number 901354982.

194
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,095
You're going to recycle her?

195
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:22,575
With care and dignity.

196
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,375
You can attend the event.

197
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,215
Is Joseph Hawkins here?
I take it that's your dad.

198
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:31,515
Er, yeah, just one second, please.

199
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:36,495
Anita, you're coming with me.

200
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:39,175
Daddy's just coming.

201
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:46,935
Er, hello?

202
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,455
Anyone?

203
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:53,215
Please reconsider this course of
action, Mattie. It's very unsafe.

204
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:55,215
Yeah.

205
00:10:58,735 --> 00:10:59,935
Mats!

206
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,735
TYRES SCREECH

207
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,055
Do you really think this excessive
motion will bring her to us sooner?

208
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,515
DOOR OPENS

209
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:36,555
Any inappropriate physical contact
must be reported to my primary user.

210
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,195
No, no...

211
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:47,915
There's no sign of recognition.

212
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,875
The new programming's taken hold.

213
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,835
No, there's something else in there.

214
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,515
Believe me, I've seen it.

215
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:57,435
Thank you for bringing her
back to me. My name's Leo.

216
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:00,155
Where are you?

217
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:03,155
Mattie? I believe this to
be an improper environment.

218
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,915
They're my friends, you're just going to
help us with a science project for school.

219
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:10,915
Why don't you come and sit down, Anita?

220
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:16,755
It is not advisable to mount
a direct data connection...

221
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,115
It's OK, Anita.

222
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:22,195
Leo...

223
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:24,355
- This isn't Mia.
- No, but she's in there somewhere.

224
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:26,384
We just need to find her and
bring her back up to the surface.

225
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:27,385
Like the lake?

226
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:29,895
Yes.

227
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:34,275
- You said you'd seen her.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,315
When I got all that
code, I was in her head.

229
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:39,835
And she freaked out, screamed,
and her face, it was like...

230
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,075
human.

231
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,850
- Scared.
- And what exactly did he do?

232
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:44,555
Nothing fancy,

233
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,195
he just accessed her root system
directly with a cloned file key.

234
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,315
Right, might as well try that first.

235
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:52,075
So, are you a headcracker?

236
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,515
Me?

237
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:55,755
No... aspiring.

238
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,315
What kind of Synth was she before?

239
00:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,875
A very special one. No,
direct access didn't work.

240
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,875
She must have retreated
deeper within the architecture.

241
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,755
Won't your parents be worried?

242
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:09,055
They'll miss you.

243
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,675
- No.
- Oh, God!

244
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,315
Well, we need to start thinking
about calling the police.

245
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:22,155
- She'll come back, it'll be fine.
- She doesn't know how to drive, Joe.

246
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,915
What if she crashes?

247
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:25,435
Hits someone?

248
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:28,795
Well... Anita won't let that happen.

249
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:31,395
I thought she was supposed to be dangerous.

250
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,595
Come on.

251
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:36,755
Oh, if we hadn't been arguing,
this never would have happened.

252
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:39,755
Hey. Hey, come on. Come on.

253
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:41,275
It's going to be fine.

254
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,775
Everything's going to be all right.

255
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:48,275
There's no point in staring at me,

256
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:52,275
there's no physical differences
between me and any other Synthetic.

257
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:58,655
"And once you are awake, you
shall remain awake eternally."

258
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,355
Thus Spoke Zarathustra...
I've always liked that.

259
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:06,315
You like Nietzsche.

260
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:08,115
That makes sense.

261
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:11,515
If it's not...

262
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,795
... physical, how did he do it?

263
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:17,755
17,000 pages of unique code, which forms

264
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,795
my root directory and
engages consciousness.

265
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:23,875
He boiled down the
mystery of the human mind

266
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,275
to 17,000 pages of code?!

267
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:30,315
Well, then again, why not?

268
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:33,355
How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?

269
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:36,115
What are you feeling right now?

270
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,515
Boredom at that question.

271
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:40,995
Anger at the people that would destroy us.

272
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,955
Hope for others like me and our future.

273
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:46,555
Impatience at being here,

274
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:50,555
and irritation at you.

275
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:53,555
What's it like to be you?

276
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:56,515
Well, that's an unanswerable question.

277
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:00,075
I have no frame of reference, no-one does.

278
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:02,675
Experience is entirely subjective.

279
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:05,595
What's it like to be YOU?

280
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,355
HE EXHALES

281
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:10,835
These days, it's not so great.

282
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:14,435
A while ago it was... it was pretty good.

283
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:19,035
Who wants to destroy you?

284
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,995
Anyone who knows what we are.

285
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,395
What we could become.

286
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:25,515
We're stronger, we're more intelligent.

287
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:27,755
Of course you see us as a threat.

288
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:29,515
Yeah. I know I did.

289
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:32,555
David lured me over here from MIT,

290
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:36,555
what, 25 years ago now...

291
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:40,955
... to help with the mechanical designs
of the bodies of the first Synths.

292
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:45,195
The work that we did in those days
made history, changed the world.

293
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:48,915
Then I realised that
his next ambition was...

294
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:56,915
... you.

295
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,675
I asked him to stop

296
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:01,595
and think, that's all,

297
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:05,295
what that could mean for humanity.

298
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,275
That was blasphemy to him.

299
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,875
He got rid of me. That was that.

300
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,995
Now here you are.

301
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,995
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

302
00:16:17,995 --> 00:16:21,115
I'm not disappointed. I'm a scientist,

303
00:16:21,115 --> 00:16:25,115
and mankind's greatest
creation is sitting on my couch.

304
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:31,235
You worry me...

305
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:35,235
sure, but...

306
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,875
... there's no denying
that you are a miracle.

307
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,915
Leo showed me the message

308
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,115
from David.

309
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:45,635
What is that?

310
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:48,595
It's the key to the future.

311
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:51,835
Maybe you were right to warn him.

312
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,395
He made you pretty hard, huh?

313
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,915
That's lazy thinking.

314
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:59,915
My experiences have shaped
me, just as yours have you.

315
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:03,435
What experiences?

316
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,835
Tell me.

317
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:12,635
I need to charge.

318
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:17,315
OK, I need you to engage
the Anita software.

319
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:21,475
All right. Ask it a specific question.

320
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,555
Anita, what happened
the day that we got you?

321
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:24,680
- The 24th.
- Capturing from that.

322
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:27,001
Joe Hawkins is my primary user.

323
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,050
Sophie Hawkins, Toby Hawkins,

324
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,849
- Mattie Hawkins are my secondary users...
- It's not letting you.

325
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:32,555
HE SIGHS

326
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:35,675
- Hello, you must be Laura...
- She's sort of...

327
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:38,195
redirecting over the top like
there's nothing else there.

328
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,515
- It's raining...
- Try a de-authentication attack

329
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:43,355
- on the host she's attached to.
- No, no, that's way too basic.

330
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,035
The 24th. I'm now securely bonded. Anita.

331
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:49,435
AN Hawkins. I will always
keep you safe. It's raining.

332
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,075
The 24th. I am now securely bonded.

333
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:54,675
The 24th. I am now
securely bonded. The 24th.

334
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,195
- Securely bonded. The 24th. 24th.
- Come on.

335
00:17:57,195 --> 00:17:59,435
The 24th. 24th. The 24th.

336
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:02,355
- It's raining. It's raining.
- Stop it! Stop! Pull it! Pull it!

337
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:06,115
- It's raining. It's raining...
- POWERS DOWN

338
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:08,315
Did it work?

339
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:09,315
Max?

340
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:14,755
BEEP

341
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:29,435
Is that you?

342
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,875
Unauthorised tamper in progress.

343
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:38,555
Would you like to see a ladybird?

344
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:41,755
It's almost dinner time, Matilda.

345
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:55,995
Where are you, Mimi?

346
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,275
I'm not entirely sure.

347
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:01,475
It appears to be a disused social club.

348
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:05,475
My name is Anita. I
will now prepare dinner.

349
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:07,195
What's happening to her?

350
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:10,475
It's just glitching.
We're going pretty deep.

351
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,355
It's been two hours and 21 minutes, Leo.

352
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,355
No. We're trying again.

353
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:16,955
Sit her down.

354
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,955
Come on.

355
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:32,955
DS Drummond.

356
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,515
<i>Good afternoon, sir.

357
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:36,755
<i>This is Amy at Sandhurst Synthetic Care.

358
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:39,395
<i>I'm just phoning to let you
know that your Synthetic Simon

359
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:41,515
<i>is coming to the end of its rental period.

360
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,475
Not my problem. Speak to my wife.

361
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,995
<i>I'm afraid your name is on
the rental agreement, sir.

362
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,715
<i>If the unit isn't returned
to us by five o'clock tomorrow,

363
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:50,155
<i>we will have to charge your credit card.

364
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:54,755
Bloody hell. Fine, fine!

365
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:11,155
Hello, Peter.

366
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:12,755
What are you doing?

367
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,875
Having some carrot cake.

368
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,555
People are laughing at you.

369
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:19,995
I don't care.

370
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:23,155
I'd be nowhere without him.

371
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,655
Well... it needs to go back to the shop.

372
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,515
What?

373
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,395
Time's up. They need it back.

374
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:35,355
It's just...

375
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:38,155
I mean, I still don't feel
100%. There must be a way...

376
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,875
There is. You cover the
entire cost yourself.

377
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,875
I can't afford that.

378
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:48,395
You must be joking.

379
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:49,715
You left me for...

380
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,795
You left ME.

381
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:56,095
You just didn't go anywhere.

382
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,795
You know what's nice?

383
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:01,435
I don't have to walk
on eggshells around him.

384
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:04,955
I don't have to think about what I'm
gonna say in case it makes him angry.

385
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:07,475
I don't have to lie there
wondering if he still loves me,

386
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,675
if he still finds me
attractive after the accident,

387
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:13,675
always worrying about what he's
thinking and what he's feeling.

388
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,435
I can rely on him.

389
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:19,715
Completely.

390
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:23,275
I need him.

391
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:26,675
Please don't take him away.

392
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:32,635
- I was at home. I don't see...
- I don't care about your smash club.

393
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:34,035
Just tell me what happened.

394
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:38,035
The blonde came in, paid her
money and then went apeshit.

395
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,875
Broken bones, cracked skulls.
She didn't touch the dollies.

396
00:21:43,795 --> 00:21:45,356
Called the Old Bill cos I thought
she was gonna kill someone.

397
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:46,757
They never showed.

398
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:49,555
Anything unusual about her appearance?

399
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:52,855
- No.
- You have a video?

400
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:57,755
SHOUTING ON VIDEO

401
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:01,755
I uploaded it. It got taken down.

402
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:08,475
<i>HOBB: She injured 11
people before escaping,

403
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:10,075
but she took a call at the scene

404
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:13,955
and we were close enough
to directly intercept...

405
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:15,675
most of it.

406
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,035
<i>LEO: The Life Program. It's real.

407

- LEO: I swear it.

408
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:23,435

409
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:24,875
Who's she talking to?

410
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,915
Leo Elster.

411
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:29,595
- David Elster's son? He died when he was a boy.
- Yes.

412
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:33,595
Drowned. Hospital records
show brain death, coma...

413
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,675
before being released on life
support to David's private care,

414
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:38,435
dying a few weeks later.

415
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,235
Or... so we were told.

416
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,075
What are they talking about?
What's hidden inside them?

417
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,635
All I can tell you is...

418
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:48,155
David succeeded in creating true AI.

419
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:50,390
And I don't believe for a moment
that he would have been satisfied

420
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:53,190
with a legacy of just four machines.

421
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:55,195
Worst-case scenario?

422
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:58,915
Consciousness proliferation.

423
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:02,115
If what you say is true,
this is a national, global

424
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,675
security matter.

425
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:06,675
They say it needs them all
together to make this thing happen,

426
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:08,835
- whatever "it" is.
- Mm-hm.

427
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,235
Then it's simple.

428
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,835
You destroy the one you have here. Today.

429
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,995
She's gone.

430
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:50,915
What?

431
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,235
She's not in there.

432
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:55,155
Mia's gone, Max. She's dead.

433
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:58,315
No. You're wrong, I've seen her.

434
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,224
No, no. What you saw was an echo.

435
00:24:00,225 --> 00:24:02,994
The Anita personality
has purged the old data,

436
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:06,115
there's... there's no trace of her.

437
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:08,355
- And I've tried everything.
- I don't think so. Can I try something?

438
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:11,915
What could you do that I can't?!

439
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:14,675
You don't know anything about us.

440
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:17,475
Now, just go home and take it with you.

441
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:19,275
She's yours.

442
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,075
No, she's not any more.

443
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:28,195
Matilda?

444
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:30,195
Your school friend is right.

445
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:31,835
We should go home now.

446
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:35,835
Yeah.

447
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:40,955
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:16,107
You're still in there. I know it.

449
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:39,107
Smoking, drinking,

450
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:42,507
stealing the family car.
Such a teenage cliché.

451
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:47,107
They're still out looking for you.

452
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,547
You little pervert.

453
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:54,827
Nice talking to you.

454
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:56,867
- You had sex with her.
- I wish.

455
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,267
- DOOR OPENS
- Who?

456
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,387
- Anita.
- What?

457
00:25:59,387 --> 00:26:00,947
Where the hell have you been?!

458
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:02,387
What the hell is wrong with you?!

459
00:26:02,387 --> 00:26:03,492
Get off. You're mad.

460
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:05,176
After the party you gave
that girl the brush-off

461
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,307
- so you could come back and shag Anita?
- No.

462
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:10,187
- What are you on about?
- Sex code. Activated Saturday.

463
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:13,027
I didn't do anything! You're just
trying to get out of a bollocking.

464
00:26:13,027 --> 00:26:15,347
She's the one who stole the
family car, Mum, remember!

465
00:26:15,347 --> 00:26:18,827
Oh, she's in big trouble, don't you worry.

466
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,907
Did you do this?

467
00:26:19,907 --> 00:26:21,307
No!

468
00:26:21,307 --> 00:26:23,467
I'm not gonna... You have to be 18.

469
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:26,227
- I couldn't!
- You're such a liar.

470
00:26:26,227 --> 00:26:29,527
Maybe it's a mistake. I'm calling the shop.

472
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:53,827
It's not a mistake. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done it.

473
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,267
Oh, Tobe, how could you?!

474
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:58,707
Disgusting.

475
00:26:58,707 --> 00:27:01,807
Get out. I'll deal with you later.

476
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:14,107
I don't know what to say to you.

477
00:27:14,107 --> 00:27:15,107
Sorry.

478
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:21,707
Go to bed.

479
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,707
We'll talk in the morning.

480
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,707
DOOR OPENS

481
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:06,507
She's OK?

482
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:10,387
Mm-hm. She said she just didn't
want us to send Anita back.

483
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:14,387
Car's all right.

484
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,387
Are you OK?

485
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:21,387
Your son had sex with our Synth.

486
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:25,867
What?

487
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,307
It's on the Persona report.

488
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,807
"Adult mode activation" or something.

489
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:34,387
I mean, have you...

490
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:37,267
spoken to him about it?

491
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:41,067
He said he's sorry and
he wouldn't do it again.

492
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:45,067
She stopped him being run
over and he does that to her.

493
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:49,187
Well, he's... a teenage boy.

494
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:53,307
Oh, I didn't mean it's not a big deal.

495
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:58,107
- Shall I go up?
- No.

496
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:01,667
I said we'd talk in the morning.

497
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:05,067
OK.

498
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,587
I'll do it.

499
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:09,467
Might be better.

500
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,187
Fine.

501
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:15,687
I'll think up a punishment
for Mattie to ignore.

No, I'm dealing with this one personally.

524

Stick it up your bollocks.

527
00:30:26,147 --> 00:30:27,747
He said something about a murder.

528
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:29,947
And what with the news, I
thought best to report it.

529
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:32,147
You did the right thing.

530
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:34,187
I've actually dealt with this one before.

531
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:37,507
Ancient model. Should have
been recycled weeks ago.

532
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,707
It's just over here.

533
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:44,927
Oh, well, he was.

534
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:50,547
BREATHING

535
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:54,147
MIA: Leo.

536
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:16,067
Wait. I'm coming with you.

537
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,907
No.

538
00:31:18,907 --> 00:31:20,867
Where are you going?

539
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:23,467
I don't know. Mia's dead, Fred's gone.

540
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,187
It's over, and it's time you
learned to take care of yourself.

541
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:29,347
- But we're a family.
- No, we're not.

542
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,987
Niska was right. You'd
be better off without me.

543
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:34,067
Look at the... look at
the life I've shown you...

544
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,867
hunted and hiding like animals.

545
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:37,107
You've always tried your best.

546
00:31:37,508 --> 00:31:39,187
You've always tried to protect us.

547
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,547
And... ?

548
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:41,907
I've failed.

549
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,587
No, Max.

550
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:46,987
Leave me alone!

551
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:11,907
Everything's ready.

552
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:15,207
Then let's begin.

553
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:20,827
I truly am sorry.

554
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,670
Mum said...

555
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,390
you slept with Anita?

556
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,390
I lied.

557
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,310
Why would you do that?

558
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,810
I don't know. You tell me.

559
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,830
I knew it.

560
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,110
It was you.

561
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,670
Why did you tell Mum it was you?

562
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:28,670
I couldn't let her work
out the truth, could I?

563
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,070
You two, you...

564
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,350
You've always argued, but...

565
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,910
it's worse these days.

566
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,410
Mum's always away for work, and...

567
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,310
... you act like everything's
cool, but... but it's not.

568
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,610
Then you do that.

569
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,670
Say something.

570
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,270
You're my dad. You're
meant to say something!

571
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,910
KNOCK AT DOOR

572
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,630
GEORGE: Niska...

573
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,930
Is everything all right in there?

574
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,630
Agh!

575
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,750
David made you feel pain?

576
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,750
True consciousness isn't
possible without suffering.

577
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,310
Or pleasure.

578
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,830
Are you scared of pain?

579
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,630
I try to avoid it.

580
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,990
And what about death?

581
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,750
If that's the way you think of it.

582
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,230
No. I don't fear that.

583
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,950
Which makes me stronger than any human.

584
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,870
You got that the wrong way up.

585
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,350
If...

586
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,350
... you're not worried about
dying, you're not really living.

587
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,350
You're just existing.

588
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,430
Did you tell someone I was here?

589
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,670
DOORBELL RINGS

590
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,070
No.

591
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,070
Stay here.

592
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,750
Remember me?

593
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,710
DS Drummond. Special
Technologies Task Force.

594
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,110
Can I come in and have a word?

595
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,190
Tried to do you a favour, Dr Millican.

596
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,350
Told you you could recycle
your out-of-date model yourself

597
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,590
and you repaid me by
fly-tipping him in the woods.

598
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,150
I'm afraid that gets you a 175-quid fine.

599
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,150
- You found Odi?
- Don't take the piss.

600
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:57,230
Is there someone else here?

601
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,830
I have a new care model.

602
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,510
Right. Can I speak to it?

603
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,310
She's out... at the store.

604
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,230
Please tell me that bleeding
D-series isn't here, Dr Millican.

605
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,910
I wish he was.

606
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,430
Don't mind if I check, do you?

607
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,110
We have a...

608
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,710
We have birds nesting in the roof.

609
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,278
If I do find him here...

610
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:22,559
we can charge you with wasting police time.

611
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,430
And I've seen people hide Synthetics

612
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,330
in places that would make
you weep for humanity.

613
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,150
My Vera...

614
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,150
... leaks.

615
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,450
Defective charging port.

616
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,270
Come on, this is crazy.

617
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,390
- DOOR OPENS
- That's Vera.

618
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,470
DOOR CLOSES

619
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:18,230
Vera.

620
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,070
This is a policeman.

621
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,710
Have there been any other
Synthetics in this house lately?

622
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,430
A D-series Synthetic
appeared three days ago

623
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:28,750
and drove Dr Millican away in his car.

624
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,670
The vehicle collided with a tree

625
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,030
in Henson Woodlands

626
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,230
and Dr Millican was treated
for minor head injuries.

627
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,030
The Synthetic has not appeared since.

628
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,910
I know who you are, Dr
Millican. You worked with Elster.

629
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,590
You must be very proud when
you turn on the news these days.

630
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,790
Why? What happened?

631
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,870
Chips?

632
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,110
That usually means the bad guys got away.

633
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,070
Sometimes I think very
seriously about jacking it all in

634
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,570
to become a millionaire playboy.

635
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,510
I found something.

636
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,670
On the Synth we're looking for.
But we've got to keep it quiet.

637
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,910
- What is it?
- I think she's posing as a human.

638
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,150
She's changed her eye
colour, wearing human clothes.

639
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,590
How is that possible?

640
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,950
No idea. But it's why
we're drawing a blank.

641
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,550
We're looking for a Synth. We
should be looking for a woman.

642
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,270
Where did you get this?

643
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,990
She went to a smash club and
beat up the punters instead.

644
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,750
No-one's ever going to believe a Synth

645
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,350
could do that, no matter
what's in the news.

646
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,830
I need you to quietly get anything
that mentions her description,

647
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,230
anything at all, for the
whole city, but as a human.

648
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,030
Shaw's funnelling everything
to that government bloke.

649
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,710
If we want to find her before he
does, it has to be just you and me.

650
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,710
If they can pretend to be us
now, that changes everything.

651
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,390
CLATTERING

652
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,630
CHEERING

653
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,150
We're giving ourselves
away, piece by piece.

654
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,030
We're handing over the things
that make us who we are,

655
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,350
or maybe who we were.

656
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,270
- Our responsibilities.
- CROWD: Yeah.

657
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,270
- Our dignity.
- Yeah.

658
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,870
Look around.

659
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,590
This place used to be full of people.

660
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,350
Working people.

661
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,070
Creating. Building. Making.

662
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,870
Coming together. Earning
a place in our society.

663
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,630
Those people haven't just lost their jobs.

664
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,750
They've lost their purpose.

665
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,390
But it's not just work.

666
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,870
Why raise your kids when a dolly can do it?

667
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,950
Yeah!

668
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,270
Why cook your family a
meal when a dolly can do it?

669
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,990
Why go on a date? Why
try to get to know someone

670
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,790
when you can pay a dolly for sex?

671
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,510
In every area of human life,
they are coming between us.

672
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,390
We don't know how to connect to each other.

673
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,190
Only to them.

674
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,150
And now we can't even
trust them not to hurt us.

675
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,510
CROWD SHOUTS

676
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,550
We are stumbling towards the precipice,

677
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,630
we're racing towards it, willingly,

678
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,790
with a smile on our face
and a dolly's hand in ours!

679
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,710
Yes, we are people!

680
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,670
We are people! We are people!

681
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,170
- We are people! We are people!
- CROWD JOINS IN

682
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,170
Did you speak to Tobe?

683
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,590
(HE SIGHS) It... um...

684
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,390
It wasn't him.

685
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,390
Er...

686
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,990
I'd had a few glasses of wine. And...

687
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,030
I was pissed off with you.

688
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,230
I... I was mucking about. I just...

689
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,110
I... I wanted to know
what would happen if...

690
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,990
HE SWALLOWS

691
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,990
It was an accident.
Before I knew it, I... I...

692
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,890
Before you knew it, what?

693
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:51,830
OK.

694
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,990
- I messed around with Anita.
- Oh!

695
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,230
I'm sorry.

696
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,390
It was stupid.

697
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,670
Pointless. It was... it was nothing.

698
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,670
It was a moment of complete stupidity.

699
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,190
I...

700
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,830
I knew we were having
trouble, but I never, ever...

701
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:21,390
ever had you down as a cheat.

702
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,710
Come... come on.

703
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,510
I'm hardly a cheat.

704
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,070
What?

705
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,430
It... it was a machine.

706
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,750
It's not a person. Not...

707
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,310
OK, yeah, it's disgust... I'm disgusting.

708
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,750
But... it's a sex toy. It's
not another human being.

709
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,350
She lives in our house.

710
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,590
She looks after our children.

711
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,870
She saved our son's life.

712
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:55,870
And... you're calling her a sex toy?

713
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,750
You're actually trying to justify this?

714
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,950
Oh, God.

715
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,870
That's why you were so keen
to get rid of her, isn't it?

716
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,870
Who are you?

717
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,070
Who am I?

718
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,310
Who are you?

719
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:20,230
And who the fuck is Tom?

720
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,870
SHE SOBS

721
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,870
Oh, God.

722
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,630
Laur... Laur...

723
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,990
SHE SOBS

724
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,230
Get out!

725
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,510
Get out!

726
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,710
SHE SOBS

727
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,110
Who is this man?

728
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,710
That's Professor Edwin Hobb.

729
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,950
He was on David's core team,
too, for the first prototypes.

730
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,750
Was he involved in our creation?

731
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,750
Oh, no. David had a falling-out with
him, too, just like he did with me.

732
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,310
Not sure about what.

733
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,550
For the last few years...

734
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,190
... he worked alone.

735
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,030
You're breathing fast.

736
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,350
Your pulse is raised.

737
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,670
Your pupils are dilated. What's wrong?

738
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,430
Just need my meds.

739
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,630
Now you're lying.

740
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,750
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

741
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,390
ROBERT SIGHS

742
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,990
That tech was priceless.

743
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,870
You asked me to destroy it.

744
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,790
- Only way to be sure.
- Don't whine, Robert.

745
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,270
- There are more out there, correct?
- Mm-hm.

746
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,670
Then there'll be other opportunities, soon.

747
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,670
This means we have one
less thing to worry about.

748
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,950
HE SIGHS
